# Database of papers mentioning 3D visualization of genomes

The idea is to have an ultimate database of papers that visualize genomes in 3D
space. The initial step is to process the data from the Kouril et al. 2025 VIS
paper.

Steps:
- [ ] process VIS paper corpus
    - [ ] try parsing out the .bib files from supplemental materials
    - [ ] marking items I found relevant/not relevant/maybe
        - when 'not relevant', mark the reason why
- [ ] figure out the best way to store


Ideally, the process for adding a paper to the database would take advantage of
the Github Issues interface:
- open up an issue (using a template) with the DOI of a paper
- some automated process checks whether the paper is in the database
- either way, we can discuss the paper
- if it is not, then we can create a PR for adding it
- if it is, then we can override the decision relevant/not relevant based on
discussion
