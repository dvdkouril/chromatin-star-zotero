Abstract = {Eggs of the European newt, Triton palmatus, were constricted by means of
   a hairloop (Spe-mann''s method) from 14 to 60 min. after insemination.
   In 154 expts., the constriction isolated the 2d maturation spindle in
   one-half of the egg, while all the spermatozoa of the normally
   polyspermic egg were confined to the other half. Of the 105 fragments
   containing the maturation spindle which were allowed to develop, 77\%
   segmented or made at least an attempt at cleavage. The development came
   to an end at stages ranging from early cleavage to late blastula. The
   cytological study shows that, during the first 3 hrs. after
   insemination, the behavior of the egg chromatin is practically the same
   as in normal fertilization. Maturation is completed, and the egg nucleus
   moves toward the cytoplasmic center of the fragment. No aster is formed.
   After the 3d hr., the egg nucleus exhibits a variety of different
   reactions 1) it degenerates without an attempt at division, or 2) grows
   to a very large vesicle and forms more or less normal chromosomes; 3) it
   divides by a peculiar type of anastral mitosis, which is followed by
   cell division and may be repeated several times, or 4) forms an abortive
   monaster, or 5) divides by normal mitosis. The detailed study of these
   various reactions of the egg nucleus affords interesting results
   concerning different problems of fertilization, mitosis, and cell
   division.},

Abstract = {T cell exhaustion plays critical roles in tumor immune evasion. Novel
   strategies to suppress immune evasion are in urgent need. We aimed to
   identify potential compounds to target T cell exhaustion and increase
   response to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). Differentially
   expressed genes (DEGs) were identified between tumors with different
   immune evasion potential by comparing the transcriptome data. DEGs were
   then analyzed in the Connectivity Map (CMap) platform to identify
   potential compounds to increase response to ICIs. Gene set enrichment
   analysis, LDH release assay, Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), and
   Co-IP were performed to explore the potential mechanisms in vitro.
   Patients derived organoids and humanized xenograft mouse model were
   utilized to validate the finding ex vivo and in vivo. We identified 25
   potential compounds that may play critical roles in regulating tumor
   immune evasion. We further pinpointed a specific compound,
   dexamethasone, which shows potent anti-tumor effect in multiple cancer
   cell lines when cocultured with T cells. Dexamethasone can suppress T
   cell exhaustion by decreasing the activity of two immune checkpoints
   simultaneously, including PD-L1 and IDO1. Functional study shows
   dexamethasone can increase the sensitivity of ICIs in coculture system,
   3D organoid model and humanized mouse model. Mechanism study shows
   dexamethasone mediated transcriptional suppression of PD-L1 and IDO1
   depends on the nuclear translocation of GR/STAT3 complex. These findings
   demonstrate dexamethasone can suppress immune evasion by inducing
   GR/STAT3 mediated downregulation of PD-L1 and IDO1 pathways.},

Title = {A Chromosome-Level Genome Assembly of the Parasitoid Wasp, <i>Cotesia
   glomerata</i> (Hymenoptera: Braconidae)},

Abstract = {Hymenopterans make up about 20\% of all animal species, but most are
   poorly known and lack high-quality genomic resources. One group of
   important, yet understudied hymenopterans are parasitoid wasps in the
   family Braconidae. Among this understudied group is the genus Cotesia, a
   Glade of similar to 1,000 species routinely used in studies of
   physiology, ecology, biological control, and genetics. However, our
   ability to understand these organisms has been hindered by a lack of
   genomic resources. We helped bridge this gap by generating a
   high-quality genome assembly for the parasitoid wasp, Cotesia glomerata
   (Braconidae; Microgastrinae). We generated this assembly using multiple
   sequencing technologies, including Oxford Nanopore, whole-genome shotgun
   sequencing, and 3D chromatin contact information (HiC). Our assembly is
   one of the most contiguous, complete, and publicly available
   hymenopteran genomes, represented by 3,355 scaffolds with a scaffold N50
   of similar to 28 Mb and a BUSCO score of similar to 99\%. Given the
   genome sizes found in closely related species, our genome assembly was
   similar to 50\% larger than expected, which was apparently induced by
   runaway amplification of 3 types of repetitive elements: simple repeats,
   long terminal repeats, and long interspersed nuclear elements. This
   assembly is another step forward for genomics across this hyperdiverse,
   yet understudied order of insects. The assembled genomic data and
   metadata files are publicly available via Figshare
   (https://doi.org/10.6084/ m9.figshare.13010549).},

Title = {A drug library screen identifies Carbenoxolone as novel FOXO inhibitor
   that overcomes FOXO3-mediated chemoprotection in high-stage
   neuroblastoma},
Journal = {ONCOGENE},

Abstract = {The transcription factor FOXO3 has been associated in different tumor
   entities with hallmarks of cancer, including metastasis, tumor
   angiogenesis, maintenance of tumor-initiating stem cells, and drug
   resistance. In neuroblastoma (NB), we recently demonstrated that nuclear
   FOXO3 promotes tumor angiogenesis in vivo and chemoresistance in vitro.
   Hence, inhibiting the transcriptional activity of FOXO3 is a promising
   therapeutic strategy. However, as no FOXO3 inhibitor is clinically
   available to date, we used a medium-throughput fluorescence polarization
   assay (FPA) screening in a drug-repositioning approach to identify
   compounds that bind to the FOXO3-DNA-binding-domain (DBD). Carbenoxolone
   (CBX), a glycyrrhetinic acid derivative, was identified as a potential
   FOXO3-inhibitory compound that binds to the FOXO3-DBD with a binding
   affinity of 19 mu M. Specific interaction of CBX with the FOXO3-DBD was
   validated by fluorescence-based electrophoretic mobility shift assay
   (FAM-EMSA). CBX inhibits the transcriptional activity of FOXO3 target
   genes, as determined by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), DEPP-, and
   BIM promoter reporter assays, and real-time RT-PCR analyses. In
   high-stage NB cells with functional TP53, FOXO3 triggers the expression
   of SESN3, which increases chemoprotection and cell survival.
   Importantly, FOXO3 inhibition by CBX treatment at pharmacologically
   relevant concentrations efficiently repressed FOXO3-mediated SESN3
   expression and clonogenic survival and sensitized high-stage NB cells to
   chemotherapy in a 2D and 3D culture model. Thus, CBX might be a
   promising novel candidate for the treatment of therapy-resistant
   high-stage NB and other ``FOXO-resistant{''} cancers.},

Journal = {ANNALS OF APPLIED STATISTICS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {13},
Number = {3},
Pages = {1511-1536},

Abstract = {Chromosome conformation capture experiments such as Hi-C are used to map
   the three-dimensional spatial organization of genomes. One specific
   feature of the 3D organization is known as topologically associating
   domains (TADs), which are densely interacting, contiguous chromatin
   regions playing important roles in regulating gene expression. A few
   algorithms have been proposed to detect TADs. In particular, the
   structure of Hi-C data naturally inspires application of community
   detection methods. However, one of the drawbacks of community detection
   is that most methods take exchangeability of the nodes in the network
   for granted; whereas the nodes in this case, that is, the positions on
   the chromosomes, are not exchangeable. We propose a network model for
   detecting TADs using Hi-C data that takes into account this
   nonexchangeability. In addition, our model explicitly makes use of
   cell-type specific CTCF binding sites as biological covariates and can
   be used to identify conserved TADs across multiple cell types. The model
   leads to a likelihood objective that can be efficiently optimized via
   relaxation. We also prove that when suitably initialized, this model
   finds the underlying TAD structure with high probability. Using
   simulated data, we show the advantages of our method and the caveats of
   popular community detection methods, such as spectral clustering, in
   this application. Applying our method to real Hi-C data, we demonstrate
   the domains identified have desirable epigenetic features and compare
   them across different cell types.},

Abstract = {Genome-wide association studies have identified noncoding variants near
   TBX3 that are associated with PR interval and QRS duration, suggesting
   that subtle changes in TBX3 expression affect atrioventricular
   conduction system function. To explore whether and to what extent the
   atrioventricular conduction system is affected by Tbx3 dose reduction,
   we first characterized electrophysiological properties and morphology of
   heterozygous Tbx3 mutant (Tbx3(+/-)) mouse hearts. We found PR interval
   shortening and prolonged QRS duration, as well as atrioventricular
   bundle hypoplasia after birth in heterozygous mice. The atrioventricular
   node size was unaffected. Transcriptomic analysis of atrioventricular
   nodes isolated by laser capture microdissection revealed hundreds of
   deregulated genes in Tbx3(+/-) mutants. Notably, Tbx3(+/)(-)
   atrioventricular nodes showed increased expression of working myocardial
   gene programs (mitochondria) and metabolic processes, muscle
   contractility) and reduced expression of pacemaker gene programs
   (neuronal, Wnt signaling, calcium/ion channel activity). By integrating
   chromatin accessibility profiles (ATAC sequencing) of atrioventricular
   tissue and other epigenetic data, we identified Tbx3-dependent
   atrioventricular regulatory DNA elements (REs) on a genome-wide scale.
   We used transgenic reporter assays to determine the functionality of
   candidate REs near Ryr2, an up-regulated chamber-enriched gene, and in
   Cacna1g, a down-regulated conduction system-specific gene. Using genome
   editing to delete candidate REs, we showed that a strong intronic
   bipartite RE selectively governs Cacna1g expression in the conduction
   system in vivo. Our data provide insights into the multifactorial
   Tbx3-dependent transcriptional network that regulates the structure and
   function of the cardiac conduction system, which may underlie the
   differences in PR duration and QRS interval between individuals carrying
   variants in the TBX3 locus.},

Abstract = {Use of low resolution single cell DNA FISH and population based high
   resolution chromosome conformation capture techniques have highlighted
   the importance of pairwise chromatin interactions in gene regulation.
   However, it is unlikely that associations involving regulatory elements
   act in isolation of other interacting partners that also influence their
   impact. Indeed, the influence of multi-loci interactions remains
   something of an enigma as beyond low-resolution DNA FISH we do not have
   the appropriate tools to analyze these. Here we present a method that
   uses standard 4C-seq data to identify multi-loci interactions from the
   same cell. We demonstrate the feasibility of our method using 4C-seq
   data sets that identify known pairwise and novel tri-loci interactions
   involving the Tcrb and Igk antigen receptor enhancers. We further show
   that the three Igk enhancers, MiE kappa, 3'E kappa and Ed kappa,
   interact simultaneously in this super-enhancer cluster, which add to our
   previous findings showing that loss of one element decreases
   interactions between all three elements as well as reducing their
   transcriptional output. These findings underscore the functional
   importance of simultaneous interactions and provide new insight into the
   relationship between enhancer elements. Our method opens the door for
   studying multi-loci interactions and their impact on gene regulation in
   other biological settings.},

Abstract = {Heterogeneity is a hallmark of cancer. The advent of single-cell
   technologies has helped uncover heterogeneity in a high-throughput
   manner in different cancers across varied contexts. Here we apply
   single-cell sequencing technologies to reveal inherent heterogeneity in
   assumptively monoclonal pancreatic cancer (PDAC) cell lines and
   patient-derived organoids (PDOs). Our findings reveal a high degree of
   both genomic and transcriptomic polyclonality in monolayer PDAC cell
   lines, custodial variation induced by growing apparently identical cell
   lines in different laboratories, and transcriptomic shifts in
   transitioning from 2D to 3D spheroid growth models. Our findings also
   call into question the validity of widely available immortalized,
   non-transformed pancreatic lines as contemporaneous ``control{''} lines
   in experiments. We confirm these findings using a variety of independent
   assays, including but not limited to whole exome sequencing, single-cell
   copy number variation sequencing (scCNVseq), single-nuclei assay for
   transposase-accessible chromatin with sequencing, fluorescence in-situ
   hybridization, and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq). We map scRNA
   expression data to unique genomic clones identified by
   orthogonally-gathered scCNVseq data of these same PDAC cell lines.
   Further, while PDOs are known to reflect the cognate in vivo biology of
   the parental tumor, we identify transcriptomic shifts during ex vivo
   passage that might hamper their predictive abilities over time. The
   impact of these findings on rigor and reproducibility of experimental
   data generated using established preclinical PDAC models between and
   across laboratories is uncertain, but a matter of concern.},

Abstract = {Regulatory T cells (Treg) are critical for preventing autoimmunity and
   curtailing responses of conventional effector T cells (Tconv). The
   reprogramming of T-cell fate and function to generate Treg requires
   switching on and off of key gene regulatory networks, which may be
   initiated by a subtle shift in expression levels of specific genes. This
   can be achieved by intermediary regulatory processes that include
   microRNA and long noncoding RNA-based regulation of gene expression.
   There are well-documented microRNA profiles in Treg and Tconv, and these
   can operate to either reinforce or reduce expression of a specific set
   of target genes, including FOXP3 itself. This type of
   feedforward/feedback regulatory loop is normally stable in the steady
   state, but can alter in response to local cues or genetic risk. This may
   go some way to explaining T-cell plasticity. In addition, in chronic
   inflammation or autoimmunity, altered Treg/Tconv function may be
   influenced by changes in enhancer-promoter interactions, which are
   highly cell type-specific. These interactions are impacted by genetic
   risk based on genome-wide association studies and may cause subtle
   alterations to the gene regulatory networks controlled by or controlling
   FOXP3 and its target genes. Recent insights into the 3D organisation of
   chromatin and the mapping of noncoding regulatory regions to the genes
   they control are shedding new light on the direct impact of genetic risk
   on T-cell function and susceptibility to inflammatory and autoimmune
   conditions.},

Title = {Deep probabilistic tracking of particles in fluorescence microscopy
   images},
Journal = {MEDICAL IMAGE ANALYSIS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {72},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Tracking of particles in temporal fluorescence microscopy image
   sequences is of fundamental importance to quantify dynamic processes of
   intracellular structures as well as virus structures. We introduce a
   prob-abilistic deep learning approach for fluorescent particle tracking,
   which is based on a recurrent neural network that mimics classical
   Bayesian filtering. Compared to previous deep learning methods for
   parti-cle tracking, our approach takes into account uncertainty, both
   aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty. Thus, information about the
   reliability of the computed trajectories is determined. Manual tuning of
   tracking parameters is not necessary and prior knowledge about the noise
   statistics is not required. Short and long-term temporal dependencies of
   individual object dynamics are exploited for state prediction, and
   assigned detections are used to update the predicted states. For
   correspondence finding, we introduce a neural network which computes
   assignment probabilities jointly across multiple detections as well as
   determines the probabilities of missing detections. Training requires
   only simulated data and therefore te-dious manual annotation of ground
   truth is not needed. We performed a quantitative performance evalu-ation
   based on synthetic and real 2D as well as 3D fluorescence microscopy
   images. We used image data of the Particle Tracking Challenge as well as
   real time-lapse fluorescence microscopy images displaying virus
   structures and chromatin structures. It turned out that our approach
   yields state-of-the-art results or improves the tracking results
   compared to previous methods. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {Intrinsically disordered proteins, IDPs, are proteins that lack a rigid
   3D structure under physiological conditions, at least in vitro. Despite
   the lack of structure, IDPs play important roles in biological processes
   and transition from disorder to order upon binding to their targets.
   With multiple conformational states and rapid conformational dynamics,
   they engage in myriad and often ``promiscuous{''} interactions. These
   stochastic interactions between IDPs and their partners, defined here as
   conformational noise, is an inherent characteristic of IDP interactions.
   The collective effect of conformational noise is an ensemble of protein
   network configurations, from which the most suitable can be explored in
   response to perturbations, conferring protein networks with remarkable
   flexibility and resilience. Moreover, the ubiquitous presence of IDPs as
   transcriptional factors and, more generally, as hubs in protein
   networks, is indicative of their role in propagation of transcriptional
   (genetic) noise. As effectors of transcriptional and conformational
   noise, IDPs rewire protein networks and unmask latent interactions in
   response to perturbations. Thus, noise-driven activation of latent
   pathways could underlie state-switching events such as cellular
   transformation in cancer. To test this hypothesis, we created a model of
   a protein network with the topological characteristics of a cancer
   protein network and tested its response to a perturbation in presence of
   IDP hubs and conformational noise. Because numerous IDPs are found to be
   epigenetic modifiers and chromatin remodelers, we hypothesize that they
   could further channel noise into stable, heritable genotypic changes.},

Title = {The life and miracles of kinetochores},
Journal = {EMBO JOURNAL},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {28},
Number = {17},
Pages = {2511-2531},
Month = {SEP 2},
Abstract = {Kinetochores are large protein assemblies built on chromosomal loci
   named centromeres. The main functions of kinetochores can be grouped
   under four modules. The first module, in the inner kinetochore,
   contributes a sturdy interface with centromeric chromatin. The second
   module, the outer kinetochore, contributes a microtubule-binding
   interface. The third module, the spindle assembly checkpoint, is a
   feedback control mechanism that monitors the state of
   kinetochore-microtubule attachment to control the progression of the
   cell cycle. The fourth module discerns correct from improper
   attachments, preventing the stabilization of the latter and allowing the
   selective stabilization of the former. In this review, we discuss how
   the molecular organization of the four modules allows a dynamic
   integration of kinetochore-microtubule attachment with the prevention of
   chromosome segregation errors and cell-cycle progression. The EMBO

Title = {LMTK3 confers chemo-resistance in breast cancer},
Journal = {ONCOGENE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {37},
Number = {23},
Pages = {3113-3130},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Lemur tyrosine kinase 3 (LMTK3) is an oncogenic kinase that is involved
   in different types of cancer (breast, lung, gastric, colorectal) and
   biological processes including proliferation, invasion, migration,
   chromatin remodeling as well as innate and acquired endocrine
   resistance. However, the role of LMTK3 in response to cytotoxic
   chemotherapy has not been investigated thus far. Using both 2D and 3D
   tissue culture models, we found that overexpression of LMTK3 decreased
   the sensitivity of breast cancer cell lines to cytotoxic (doxorubicin)
   treatment. In a mouse model we showed that ectopic overexpression of
   LMTK3 decreases the efficacy of doxorubicin in reducing tumor growth.
   Interestingly, breast cancer cells overexpressing LMTK3 delayed the
   generation of double strand breaks (DSBs) after exposure to doxorubicin,
   as measured by the formation of gamma H2AX foci. This effect was at
   least partly mediated by decreased activity of ataxia-telangiectasia
   mutated kinase (ATM) as indicated by its reduced phosphorylation levels.
   In addition, our RNA-seq analyses showed that doxorubicin differentially
   regulated the expression of over 700 genes depending on LMTK3 protein
   expression levels. Furthermore, these genes were found to promote DNA
   repair, cell viability and tumorigenesis processes / pathways in
   LMTK3-overexpressing MCF7 cells. In human cancers, immunohistochemistry
   staining of LMTK3 in pre- and postchemotherapy breast tumor pairs from
   four separate clinical cohorts revealed a significant increase of LMTK3
   following both doxorubicin and docetaxel based chemotherapy. In
   aggregate, our findings show for the first time a contribution of LMTK3
   in cytotoxic drug resistance in breast cancer.},

Abstract = {Cis -regulatory elements are important molecular switches in controlling
   gene expression and are regarded as determinant hubs in the
   transcriptional regulatory network. Collection and processing of
   large-scale cis -regulatory data are urgent to decipher the potential
   mechanisms of cardiovascular diseases from a cis -regulatory element
   aspect. Here, we developed a novel web server, Cis-Cardio, which aims to
   document a large number of available cardiovascular-related cis
   -regulatory data and to provide analysis for unveiling the comprehensive
   mechanisms at a cis -regulation level. The current version of Cis-Cardio
   catalogs a total of 45,382,361 genomic regions from 1,013 human and
   mouse epigenetic datasets, including ATAC-seq, DNase-seq, Histone
   ChIP-seq, TF/TcoF ChIP-seq, RNA polymerase ChIP-seq, and Cohesin
   ChIP-seq. Importantly, Cis-Cardio provides six analysis tools, including
   region overlap analysis, element upstream/downstream analysis,
   transcription regulator enrichment analysis, variant interpretation, and
   protein-protein interaction-based co-regulatory analysis. Additionally,
   Cis-Cardio provides detailed and abundant (epi-) genetic annotations in
   cis -regulatory regions, such as super-enhancers, enhancers,
   transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs), methylation sites, common
   SNPs, risk SNPs, expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), motifs,
   DNase I hypersensitive sites (DHSs), and 3D chromatin interactions. In
   summary, Cis-Cardio is a valuable resource for elucidating and analyzing
   regulatory cues of cardiovascular-specific cis -regulatory elements. The

Title = {Cellular reprogramming is driven by widespread rewiring of
   promoter-enhancer interactions},
Journal = {BMC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {21},
Number = {1},
Month = {NOV 20},
Abstract = {Background Long-range interactions between promoters and cis-regulatory
   elements, such as enhancers, play critical roles in gene regulation.
   However, the role of three-dimensional (3D) chromatin structure in
   orchestrating changes in transcriptional regulation during direct cell
   reprogramming is not fully understood.Results Here, we performed
   integrated analyses of chromosomal architecture, epigenetics, and gene
   expression using Hi-C, promoter Capture Hi-C (PCHi-C), ChIP-seq, and
   RNA-seq during trans-differentiation of Pre-B cells into macrophages
   with a beta-estradiol inducible C/EBP alpha ER transgene. Within 1h of
   beta-estradiol induction, C/EBP alpha translocated from the cytoplasm to
   the nucleus, binding to thousands of promoters and putative regulatory
   elements, resulting in the downregulation of Pre-B cell-specific genes
   and induction of macrophage-specific genes. Hi-C results were remarkably
   consistent throughout trans-differentiation, revealing only a small
   number of TAD boundary location changes, and A/B compartment switches
   despite significant changes in the expression of thousands of genes.
   PCHi-C revealed widespread changes in promoter-anchored loops with
   decreased interactions in parallel with decreased gene expression, and
   new and increased promoter-anchored interactions in parallel with
   increased expression of macrophage-specific genes.Conclusions Overall,
   our data demonstrate that C/EBP alpha-induced trans-differentiation
   involves few changes in genome architecture at the level of TADs and A/B
   compartments, in contrast with widespread reorganization of thousands of
   promoter-anchored loops in association with changes in gene expression
   and cell identity.},

Title = {Dual therapeutic targeting of MYC and JUNB transcriptional programs for
   enhanced anti-myeloma activity},
Journal = {BLOOD CANCER JOURNAL},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {14},
Number = {1},
Month = {AUG 19},
Abstract = {Deregulation of transcription factors (TFs) leading to uncontrolled
   proliferation of tumor cells within the microenvironment represents a
   hallmark of cancer. However, the biological and clinical impact of
   transcriptional interference, particularly in multiple myeloma (MM)
   cells, remains poorly understood. The present study shows for the first
   time that MYC and JUNB, two crucial TFs implicated in MM pathogenesis,
   orchestrate distinct transcriptional programs. Specifically, our data
   revealed that expression levels of MYC, JUNB, and their respective
   downstream targets do not correlate and that their global
   chromatin-binding patterns are not significantly overlapping.
   Mechanistically, MYC expression was not affected by JUNB knockdown, and
   conversely, JUNB expression and transcriptional activity were not
   affected by MYC knockdown. Moreover, suppression of MYC levels in MM
   cells via targeting the master regulator BRD4 by either siRNA-mediated
   knockdown or treatment with the novel proteolysis targeting chimera
   (PROTAC) MZ-1 overcame bone marrow (BM) stroma cell/IL-6-induced MYC-
   but not MEK-dependent JUNB-upregulation and transcriptional activity.
   Consequently, targeting of the two non-overlapping MYC- and
   JUNB-transcriptoms by MZ-1 in combination with genetic or
   pharmacological JUNB-targeting approaches synergistically enhanced MM
   cell death, both in 2D and our novel dynamic 3D models of the BM milieu
   as well as in murine xenografts. In summary, our data emphasize the
   opportunity to employ MYC and JUNB dual-targeting treatment strategies
   in MM as another exciting approach to further improve patient outcomes.},

Abstract = {Glioblastoma (GBM) is a complex brain cancer with frequent relapses and
   high mortality and still awaits effective treatment. Mitochondria
   dysfunction is a pathogenic condition in GBM and could be a prime
   therapeutic target for ceasing GBM progression. Strategies to overcome
   brain solid tumor barriers and selectively target mitochondria within
   specific cell types may improve GBM treatment. Here, we present
   hypericin-conjugated gold nanoparticles (PEG-AuNPs@Hyp) where hypericin
   is a mitochondrion-targeting agent exhibiting multimodal therapy by
   critically impacting the IDH2 gene (Isocitrate dehydrogenase) and its
   interaction with polycomb methyltransferase EZH1/2 for GBM therapy. It
   significantly localizes in mitochondria by enhanced cellular uptake in
   the human GBM cell lines/three-dimensional (3D) culture model under
   red-light exposure. It triggers oxidative stress and changes the
   mitochondrial potential, with increased Bax/Bcl2 ratio enhancing GBM
   cell death. The suppressed expression of mutated IDH2 and polycomb group
   of proteins upon PEG-AuNPs@Hyp/light exposure regulates
   mitochondria-targeting-mediated GBM metabolism with epigenetic
   repression of complex machinery function. Polyubiquitination and
   proteasomal degradation of EZH1 indicate the implication of these
   polycomb proteins in GBM progression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation
   reveals the IDH2 and EZH1/EZH2 direct interaction, confirming the role
   played by IDH2 in modulating the expression of EZH1 and EZH2. In vivo
   studies further displayed better tumor ablation in a GBM tumor-bearing
   nude mouse model. The present multimodal nanoformulation compromised the
   functional dependency of polycomb on mitochondrial IDH2 and established
   the mechanism of GBM inhibition.},

Abstract = {The spatiotemporal relationships in high-resolution during odontogenesis
   remain poorly understood. We report a cell lineage and atlas of
   developing mouse teeth. We performed a large-scale (92,688 cells) single
   cell RNA sequencing, tracing the cell trajectories during odontogenesis
   from embryonic days 10.5 to 16.5. Combined with an assay for
   transposase-accessible chromatin with high-throughput sequencing, our
   results suggest that mesenchymal cells show the specific transcriptome
   profiles to distinguish the tooth types. Subsequently, we identified key
   gene regulatory networks in teeth and bone formation and uncovered
   spatiotemporal patterns of odontogenic mesenchymal cells. CD24(+) and
   Plac8(+) cells from the mesenchyme at the bell stage were distributed in
   the upper half and preodontoblast layer of the dental papilla,
   respectively, which could individually induce nonodontogenic epithelia
   to form tooth-like structures. Specifically, the Plac8(+) tissue we
   discovered is the smallest piece with the most homogenous cells that
   could induce tooth regeneration to date. Our work reveals previously
   unknown heterogeneity and spatiotemporal patterns of tooth germs that
   may lead to tooth regeneration for regenerative dentistry. (C) 2022

Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},

Abstract = {DNA elimination is a radical form of gene silencing and occurs both in
   somatic and germ cells. The programmed DNA elimination occurs during
   gametogenesis in interspecies hybrids that reproduce by hybridogenesis
   (stick insects, fishes, and amphibians) and concerns removal of whole
   genomes of one of the parental species and production of clonal gametes
   propagating the genome of the other species. The cellular mechanisms
   differ considerably in hybridogenetic insects and fishes but remains
   unknown in edible frogs Pelophylax esculentus, natural hybrids between
   Pelophylax lessonae and Pelophylax ridibundus. Here we report DNA
   elimination mechanism in early developing gonads of diploid and triploid
   hybrid frogs, studied by TEM, immunofluorescence, and cytochemistry. In
   gonocytes of both sexes (primary oogonia and prespermatogonia),
   micronuclei emerge as detached nuclear buds formed during interphase. We
   found depletion of nuclear pore complexes in micronuclear membrane and
   chromatin inactivation via heterochromatinization followed by
   degradation of micronuclei by autophagy. Micronuclei formation does not
   lead to apoptotic cell death showing that genome elimination is a
   physiological process. Chromatin elimination via micronuclei in P.
   esculentus is unique among hybridogenetic animals and contributes to
   broadening the knowledge about reproductive modes in animals.},

Abstract = {Structural variations (SVs) are recognized to have an important role in
   transcriptional regulation, especially in the light of resolved 3D
   genome structure using high-throughput chromosome conformation capture
   (Hi-C) technology in mammals. However, the effect of SVs on 3D genome
   organization in plants remains rarely understood. In this study, we
   identified 295,496 SVs and 5251 topologically associating domains (TADs)
   in two diploid and two tetraploid cottons. We observed that
   approximately 16\% of SVs occurred in TAD boundary regions that were
   called boundary affecting-structural variations (BA-SVs), and had a
   large effect on disrupting TAD organization. Nevertheless, SVs preferred
   occurring in TAD interior instead of TAD boundary, probably associated
   with the relaxed evolutionary selection pressure. We noticed the biased
   evolution of the At and Dt subgenomes of tetraploid cottons, in terms of
   SV-mediated disruption of 3D genome structure relative to diploids. In
   addition, we provide evidence showing that both SVs and TAD disruption
   could lead to expression difference of orthologous genes. This study
   advances our understanding of the effect of SVs on 3D genome
   organization and gene expression regulation in plants.},

Abstract = {The regulation of gene expression is mediated via the complex
   three-dimensional (3D) conformation of the genetic material and its
   interactions with various intracellular factors. Various experimental
   and computational approaches have been developed in recent years for
   understating the relation between the 3D conformation of the genome and
   the phenotypes of cells in normal condition and diseases.
   In this review, we will discuss novel approaches for analyzing and
   modeling the 3D genomic conformation, focusing on deciphering
   disease-causing mutations that affect gene expression. We conclude that
   as this is a very challenging mission, an important direction should
   involve the comparative analysis of various 3D models from various
   organisms or cells. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   to be its most prominent role, we now know that the centromere functions
   beyond cellular division with important roles in genome organization and
   chromatin regulation. Here we aim to share the structures and functions
   of centromeres in various organisms beginning with the diversity of
   their DNA sequence anatomies. We zoom out to describe their position in
   the nucleus and ultimately detail the different ways they contribute to
   genome organization and regulation at the spatial level.},

Title = {Activation of IGFBP4 via unconventional mechanism of miRNA attenuates
   metastasis of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma},
Journal = {HEPATOLOGY INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 JUN 22},
Abstract = {BackgroundIntrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) is the second most
   common primary liver malignancy. Although its incidence is lower than
   that of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), ICC has a worse prognosis, and
   it is more prone to recur and metastasize, resulting in a far greater
   level of malignancy.MethodsBioinformatics analysis and qRT-PCR were
   applied to assess the level of miR-122-5p and IGFBP4. Western blot,
   transwell assays, wound-healing assays, real-time cellular invasion
   monitoring, in vivo study were applied to explore the function of
   miR-122-5p and IGFBP4. Dual luciferase reporter assays and chromatin
   isolation by RNA purification (ChiRP) were applied to explore the
   regulation of IGFBP4 by miR-122-5p.ResultsUsing The Cancer Genome Atlas
   (TCGA) data set, Sir Run Run Shaw hospital data set and bioinformatics
   analyses, we identified miR-122-5p as a potential tumor suppressor in
   ICC and validated its suppressive effect in metastasis and invasion of
   ICC. Transcriptome sequencing, rescue and complement experiments were
   used to identify insulin-like growth factor binding protein 4 (IGFBP4)
   as a target of miR-122-5p. The mechanism by which miR-122-5p regulates
   IGFBP4 was clarified by chromatin separation RNA purification
   technology, and dual-luciferase reporter assays. We discovered a rare
   novel mechanism by which miR-122-5p promotes IGFBP4 mRNA transcription
   by binding to its promoter region. Furthermore, in mouse orthotopic
   metastasis model, miR-122-5p inhibited the invasion of ICC.ConclusionIn
   summary, our study revealed a novel mechanism of miR-122-5p and function
   of the miR-122-5p/IGFBP4 axis in the metastasis of ICC. We also
   highlighted the clinical value of miR-122-5p and IGFBP4 in inhibiting
   ICC invasion and metastasis.},

Title = {Molecular Insights Into Regulatory T-Cell Adaptation to Self,
   Environment, and Host Tissues: Plasticity or Loss of Function in
   Autoimmune Disease},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN IMMUNOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {11},
Month = {SEP 15},
Abstract = {There has been much interest in the ability of regulatory T cells (Treg)
   to switch functionin vivo, either as a result of genetic risk of disease
   or in response to environmental and metabolic cues. The relationship
   between levels of FOXP3 and functional fitness plays a significant part
   in this plasticity. There is an emerging role for Treg in tissue repair
   that may be less dependent on FOXP3, and the molecular mechanisms
   underpinning this are not fully understood. As a result of detailed,
   high-resolution functional genomics, the gene regulatory networks and
   key functional mediators of Treg phenotype downstream of FOXP3 have been
   mapped, enabling a mechanistic insight into Treg function. This
   transcription factor-driven programming of T-cell function to generate
   Treg requires the switching on and off of key genes that form part of
   the Treg gene regulatory network and raises the possibility that this is
   reversible. It is plausible that subtle shifts in expression levels of
   specific genes, including transcription factors and non-coding RNAs,
   change the regulation of the Treg gene network. The subtle skewing of
   gene expression initiates changes in function, with the potential to
   promote chronic disease and/or to license appropriate inflammatory
   responses. In the case of autoimmunity, there is an underlying genetic
   risk, and the interplay of genetic and environmental cues is complex and
   impacts gene regulation networks frequently involving promoters and
   enhancers, the regulatory elements that control gene expression levels
   and responsiveness. These promoter-enhancer interactions can operate
   over long distances and are highly cell type specific. In autoimmunity,
   the genetic risk can result in changes in these enhancer/promoter
   interactions, and this mainly impacts genes which are expressed in T
   cells and hence impacts Treg/conventional T-cell (Tconv) function.
   Genetic risk may cause the subtle alterations to the responsiveness of
   gene regulatory networks which are controlled by or control FOXP3 and
   its target genes, and the application of assays of the 3D organization
   of chromatin, enabling the connection of non-coding regulatory regions
   to the genes they control, is revealing the direct impact of
   environmental/metabolic/genetic risk on T-cell function and is providing
   mechanistic insight into susceptibility to inflammatory and autoimmune
   conditions.},

Title = {Antihypertrophic Memory After Regression of Exercise-Induced
   Physiological Myocardial Hypertrophy Is Mediated by the Long Noncoding
   RNA Mhrt779},
Journal = {CIRCULATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {143},

Pages = {2277-2292},
Month = {JUN 8},
Abstract = {Background:
   Exercise can induce physiological myocardial hypertrophy (PMH), and
   former athletes can live 5 to 6 years longer than nonathletic controls,
   suggesting a benefit after regression of PMH. We previously reported
   that regression of pathological myocardial hypertrophy has
   antihypertrophic effects. Accordingly, we hypothesized that
   antihypertrophic memory exists even after PMH has regressed, increasing
   myocardial resistance to subsequent pathological hypertrophic stress.
   Methods:
   C57BL/6 mice were submitted to 21 days of swimming training to develop
   PMH. After termination of exercise, PMH regressed within 1 week. PMH
   regression mice (exercise hypertrophic preconditioning {[}EHP] group)
   and sedentary mice (control group) then underwent transverse aortic
   constriction or a sham operation for 4 weeks. Cardiac remodeling and
   function were evaluated with echocardiography, invasive left ventricular
   hemodynamic measurement, and histological analysis. LncRNA sequencing,
   chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, and comprehensive identification of
   RNA-binding proteins by mass spectrometry and Western blot were used to
   investigate the role of Mhrt779 involved in the antihypertrophic effect
   induced by EHP.
   Results:
   At 1 and 4 weeks after transverse aortic constriction, the EHP group
   showed less increase in myocardial hypertrophy and lower expression of
   the Nppa and Myh7 genes than the sedentary group. At 4 weeks after
   transverse aortic constriction, EHP mice had less pulmonary congestion,
   smaller left ventricular dimensions and end-diastolic pressure, and a
   larger left ventricular ejection fraction and maximum pressure change
   rate than sedentary mice. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction
   revealed that the long noncoding myosin heavy chain-associated RNA
   transcript Mhrt779 was one of the markedly upregulated lncRNAs in the
   EHP group. Silencing of Mhrt779 attenuated the antihypertrophic effect
   of EHP in mice with transverse aortic constriction and in cultured
   cardiomyocytes treated with angiotensin II, and overexpression enhanced
   the antihypertrophic effect. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation assay
   and quantitative polymerase chain reaction, we found that EHP increased
   histone 3 trimethylation (H3K4me3 and H3K36me3) at the a4 promoter of
   Mhrt779. Comprehensive identification of RNA-binding proteins by mass
   spectrometry and Western blot showed that Mhrt779 can bind SWI/SNF
   related, matrix associated, actin dependent regulator of chromatin,
   subfamily a, member 4 (Brg1) to inhibit the activation of the histone
   deacetylase 2 (Hdac2)/phosphorylated serine/threonine kinase
   (Akt)/phosphorylated glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta(p-GSK3 beta)
   pathway induced by pressure overload.
   Conclusions:
   Myocardial hypertrophy preconditioning evoked by exercise increases
   resistance to pathological stress via an antihypertrophic effect
   mediated by a signal pathway of Mhrt779/Brg1/Hdac2/p-Akt/p-GSK3 beta},

Title = {22β-hydroxytingenone induces apoptosis and suppresses invasiveness of
   melanoma cells by inhibiting MMP-9 activity and MAPK signaling},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ETHNOPHARMACOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {267},
Month = {MAR 1},
Abstract = {Ethnopharmacological relevance: 22 beta-hydroxytingenone (22-HTG) is a
   quinonemethide triterpene isolated from Salacia impressifolia (Miers) A.
   C. Smith (family Celastraceae), which has been used in traditional
   medicine to treat a variety of diseases, including dengue, renal
   infections, rheumatism and cancer. However, the anticancer effects of
   22-HTG and the underlying molecular mechanisms in melanoma cells have
   not yet been elucidated. Aim of the study: The present study
   investigated apoptosis induction and antimetastatic potencial of 22-HTG
   in SK-MEL-28 human melanoma cells.
   Materials and methods: First, the in vitro cytotoxic activity of 22-HTG
   in cultured cancer cells was evaluated. Then, cell viability was
   determined using the trypan blue assay in melanoma cells (SK-MEL-28),
   which was followed by cell cycle, annexin V-FITC/propidium iodide assays
   (Annexin/PI), as well as assays to evaluate mitochondrial membrane
   potential, production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) using flow
   cytometry. Fluorescence microscopy using acridine orange/ethidium
   bromide (AO/BE) staining was also performed. RT-qPCR was carried out to
   evaluate the expression of BRAF, NRAS, and KRAS genes. The
   anti-invasiveness potential of 22-HTG was evaluated in a
   three-dimensional (3D) model of reconstructed human skin.
   Results: 22-HTG reduced viability of SK-MEL-28 cells and caused
   morphological changes, as cell shrinkage, chromatin condensation, and
   nuclear fragmentation. Furthermore, 22-HTG caused apoptosis, which was
   demonstrated by increased staining with AO/BE and Annexin/PI. The
   apoptosis may have been caused by mitochondrial instability without the
   involvement of ROS production. The expression of BRAF, NRAS, and KRAS,
   which are important biomarkers in melanoma development, was reduced by
   the 22-HTG treatment. In the reconstructed skin model, 22-HTG was able
   to decrease the invasion capacity of melanoma cells in the dermis.
   Conclusions: Our data indicate that 22-HTG has anti-tumorigenic
   properties against melanoma cells through the induction of cell cycle
   arrest, apoptosis and inhibition of invasiveness potential, as observed
   in the 3D model. As such, the results provide new insights for future
   work on the utilization of 22-HTG in malignant melanoma treatment.},

Title = {The anticancer effects of Metformin in the male germ tumor SEM-1 cell
   line are mediated by HMGA1},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ENDOCRINOLOGY},

Abstract = {IntroductionGerm cell tumors (GCTs) are the most common type of cancer
   in young men. These tumors usually originate from the testis, but they
   can occasionally develop from extragonadal sites probably due to
   primordial germ cells (PGCs) migration errors. Cisplatin-based
   chemotherapy is usually effective for male GCTs, but the risk of
   toxicity is high and new therapeutic strategies are needed. Although
   Metformin (Met) has been widely studied as a potential cancer treatment
   over the past decades, there is limited evidence to support its use in
   treating male GCTs. Additionally, the mechanism by which it acts on
   tumor cells is still not entirely understood. MethodsSEM-1 cells, a
   newly established human cell line of extragonadal origin, were treated
   with Met. Cell viability was studied by MTT assay, while cell migration
   and invasion were studied by the wound healing assay and the transwell
   assay, respectively. The effect of Met on 3D spheroid formation was
   determined by seeding SEM-1 cells in appropriate cell suspension culture
   conditions, and cell cycle was characterized by flow cytometry. Factors
   involved in PGCs migration and GCT invasion, such as IGFBP1, IGF1R,
   MMP-11 and c-Kit, together with cyclin D1 (a key regulator of cell cycle
   progression), and the upstream factor, HMGA1, were determined by
   immunoblots. ResultsTreatment of SEM-1 cells with Met resulted in a
   potent and dose-dependent reduction of cell proliferation, as evidenced
   by decreased nuclear abundance of cyclin D1 and cell cycle arrest in G1
   phase. Also, Met prevented the formation of 3D spheroids, and blocked
   cell migration and invasion by reducing the expression of IGFBP1, IGF1R
   and MMP-11. Both, IGFBP1 and MMP-11 are under control of HMGA1, a
   chromatin-associated protein that is involved in the regulation of
   important oncogenic, metabolic and embryological processes.
   Intriguingly, an early reduction in the nuclear abundance of HMGA1
   occurred in SEM-1 cells treated with Met. ConclusionsOur results
   document the antiproliferative and antimigratory effects of Met in SEM-1
   cells, providing new insights into the potential treatments for male
   GCTs. The anticancer properties of Met in SEM-1 cells are likely related
   to its ability to interfere with HMGA1 and downstream targets, including
   cyclin D1, the IGFs system, and MMP-11.},

Abstract = {Aims Degenerative mitral valve dystrophy (MVD) leading to mitral valve
   prolapse is the most frequent form of MV disease, and there is currently
   no pharmacological treatment available. The limited understanding of the
   pathophysiological mechanisms leading to MVD limits our ability to
   identify therapeutic targets. This study aimed to reveal the main
   pathophysiological pathways involved in MVD via the multimodality
   imaging and transcriptomic analysis of the new and unique knock-in (KI)
   rat model for the FilaminA-P637Q (FlnA-P637Q) mutation associated-MVD.
   Methods and results Wild-type (WT) and KI rats were evaluated
   morphologically, functionally, and histologically between 3-week-old and
   3-to-6-month-old based on Doppler echocardiography, 3D micro-computed
   tomography (microCT), and standard histology. RNA-sequencing and Assay
   for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin (ATAC-seq) were performed on
   3-week-old WT and KI mitral valves and valvular cells, respectively, to
   highlight the main signalling pathways associated with MVD.
   Echocardiographic exploration confirmed MV elongation (2.0 +/- 0.1 mm
   vs. 1.8 +/- 0.1, P = 0.001), as well as MV thickening and prolapse in KI
   animals compared to WT at 3 weeks. 3D MV volume quantified by microCT
   was significantly increased in KI animals (+58\% vs. WT, P = 0.02).
   Histological analyses revealed a myxomatous remodelling in KI MV
   characterized by proteoglycans accumulation. A persistent phenotype was
   observed in adult KI rats. Signalling pathways related to extracellular
   matrix homeostasis, response to molecular stress, epithelial cell
   migration, endothelial to mesenchymal transition, chemotaxis and immune
   cell migration, were identified based on RNA-seq analysis. ATAC-seq
   analysis points to the critical role of transforming growth factor-beta
   and inflammation in the disease. Conclusion The KI FlnA-P637Q rat model
   mimics human myxomatous MVD, offering a unique opportunity to decipher
   pathophysiological mechanisms related to this disease. Extracellular
   matrix organization, epithelial cell migration, response to mechanical
   stress, and a central contribution of immune cells are highlighted as
   the main signalling pathways leading to myxomatous MVD. Our findings
   pave the road to decipher underlying molecular mechanisms and the
   specific role of distinct cell populations in this context.},

Title = {Chromosome organization affects genome evolution in <i>Sulfolobus</i>
   archaea},

Volume = {7},

Pages = {820+},

Abstract = {In all organisms, the DNA sequence and the structural organization of
   chromosomes affect gene expression. The extremely thermophilic
   crenarchaeon Sulfolobus has one circular chromosome with three origins
   of replication. We previously revealed that this chromosome has defined
   A and B compartments that have high and low gene expression,
   respectively. As well as higher levels of gene expression, the A
   compartment contains the origins of replication. To evaluate the impact
   of three-dimensional organization on genome evolution, we characterized
   the effect of replication origins and compartmentalization on primary
   sequence evolution in eleven Sulfolobus species. Using single-nucleotide
   polymorphism analyses, we found that distance from an origin of
   replication was associated with increased mutation rates in the B but
   not in the A compartment. The enhanced polymorphisms distal to
   replication origins suggest that replication termination may have a
   causal role in their generation. Further mutational analyses revealed
   that the sequences in the A compartment are less likely to be mutated,
   and that there is stronger purifying selection than in the B
   compartment. Finally, we applied the Assay for Transposase-Accessible
   Chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) to show that the B compartment is
   less accessible than the A compartment. Taken together, our data suggest
   that compartmentalization of chromosomal DNA can influence chromosome
   evolution in Sulfolobus. We propose that the A compartment serves as a
   haven for stable maintenance of gene sequences, while sequences in the B
   compartment can be diversified.
   Analysis of eleven Sulfolobus strains reveals that chromosome
   organization affects mutation rates in this species.},

Title = {Deep Sequencing of the Murine <i>Igh</i> Repertoire Reveals Complex
   Regulation of Nonrandom V Gene Rearrangement Frequencies},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF IMMUNOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {191},
Number = {5},

Abstract = {A diverse Ab repertoire is formed through the rearrangement of V, D, and
   J segments at the IgH (Igh) loci. The C57BL/6 murine Igh locus has >100
   functional V-H gene segments that can recombine to a rearranged DJ(H).
   Although the nonrandom usage of VH genes is well documented, it is not
   clear what elements determine recombination frequency. To answer this
   question, we conducted deep sequencing of 5'-RACE products of the Igh
   repertoire in pro-B cells, amplified in an unbiased manner. Chromatin
   immunoprecipitation-sequencing results for several histone modifications
   and RNA polymerase II binding, RNA-sequencing for sense and antisense
   noncoding germline transcripts, and proximity to CCCTC-binding factor
   (CTCF) and Rad21 sites were compared with the usage of individual V
   genes. Computational analyses assessed the relative importance of these
   various accessibility elements. These elements divide the Igh locus into
   four epigenetically and transcriptionally distinct domains, and our
   computational analyses reveal different regulatory mechanisms for each
   region. Proximal V genes are relatively devoid of active histone marks
   and noncoding RNA in general, but having a CTCF site near their
   recombination signal sequence is critical, suggesting that being
   positioned near the base of the chromatin loops is important for
   rearrangement. In contrast, distal V genes have higher levels of histone
   marks and noncoding RNA, which may compensate for their poorer

Abstract = {Telocytes (TCs) are present in a broad range of species and regulate
   processes including homeostasis, tissue regeneration and
   immunosurveillance. This novel study describes the morphological
   features of migrating TCs and their role during cartilage development
   within the air-breathing organ in Clarias gariepinus, the African
   sharptooth catfish. Light microscopy (LM), transmission electron
   microscopy (TEM), and immunohistochemistry (IHC) were used to examine
   the TCs. TCs had a cell body and telopodes which formed 3D networks in
   the cartilage canals and extended their telopodes to become the foremost
   cellular elements penetrating the cartilage matrix. The TCs were also
   rich in lysosomes that secreted products to the extracellular matrix
   (ECM). In addition, TCs formed a homocellular synaptic-like structure
   that had a synaptic cleft, and the presynaptic portion consisted of a
   slightly expanded terminal of the telopodes which contained intermediate
   filaments and secretory vesicles. Gap junctions were also identified
   between TCs, which also connected to mesenchymal stem cells,
   differentiating chondrogenic cells, macrophages, apoptotic cells, and
   endothelial cells. In addition to describing the basic morphology of
   TCs, the current study also investigated migrating TCs. The TC telopodes
   acquired an irregular contour when migrating rather than exhibiting an
   extended profile. Migrating TCs additionally had ill-defined cell
   bodies, condensed chromatin, thickened telopodes, and podoms which were
   closely attached to the cell body. The TCs also expressed markers for
   MMP-9, CD117, CD34 and RhoA. In conclusion, TCs may play multiple roles
   during development and maturation, including promoting angiogenesis,
   cell migration, and regulating stem cell differentiation.},

Abstract = {Transposable elements (TEs) represent a substantial fraction of many
   eukaryotic genomes, and transcriptional regulation of these factors is
   important to determine TE activities in human cells. However, due to the
   repetitive nature of TEs, identifying transcription factor (TF)-binding
   sites from ChIP-sequencing (ChIP-seq) datasets is challenging. Current
   algorithms are focused on subtle differences between TE copies and thus
   bias the analysis to relatively old and inactive TEs. Here we describe
   an approach termed ``MapRRCon{''} (mapping repeat reads to a consensus)
   which allows us to identify proteins binding to TE DNA sequences by
   mapping ChIP-seq reads to the TE consensus sequence after whole-genome
   alignment. Although this method does not assign binding sites to
   individual insertions in the genome, it provides a landscape of
   interacting TFs by capturing factors that bind to TEs under various
   conditions. We applied this method to screen TFs' interaction with L1 in
   human cells/tissues using ENCODE ChIP-seq datasets and identified 178 of
   the 512 TFs tested as bound to L1 in at least one biological condition
   with most of them (138) localized to the promoter. Among these
   L1-binding factors, we focused on Myc and CTCF, as they play important
   roles in cancer progression and 3D chromatin structure formation.
   Furthermore, we explored the transcriptomes of The Cancer Genome Atlas
   breast and ovarian tumor samples in which a consistent anti-/correlation
   between L1 and Myc/CTCF expression was observed, suggesting that these
   two factors may play roles in regulating L1 transcription during the
   development of such tumors.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to develop a procedure to remove the TO-PRO-3
   fluorescent dye from tissue sections and restain with TO-PRO-3, still
   allowing calculation of DNA content and distribution by confocal laser
   scanning microscopy (CLSM). This would allow repeated measurements on
   the same tissue sections and prevents loss of tissue material from
   valuable clinical samples. Thick sections (14 mu m) were cut from a
   paraffin block of adrenal tissue and stained using TO-PRO-3. Image
   stacks were acquired by CLSM. Thereafter, three destaining approaches
   were tested based on incubation, at different temperatures and
   durations, in the medium that is normally used to dissolve TO-PRO-3. The
   same areas were imaged again to measure residual fluorescence and were
   subsequently restained and imaged again. The intensity of the images
   acquired after initial staining and restaining were compared. A number
   of 3-D (texture) features computed after segmentation of nuclei were
   compared as well. The best destaining result was obtained by incubation
   of sections at 37 degrees C in preheated medium twice for 20 min. On
   average, the 3-D feature values were comparable with those after initial
   staining. With the described protocol it is possible to remove TO-PRO-3
   fluorescence from tissue sections that can successfully be restained
   with minimal influence on fluorescence intensity and nuclear chromatin
   distribution. (C) 2007 International Society for Analytical Cytology.},

Abstract = {Background The classification of epithelioid pancreatic neoplasms based
   on fine-needle aspiration (FNA) is important for proper management, as
   distinction of pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms from other similar
   appearing lesions can result in significantly different treatment. Mixed
   acinar-endocrine carcinomas (MAEC) are genetically related to acinar
   carcinomas and are treated as such. We reviewed cases of MAEC to better
   characterize their cytologic and immunohistochemical features.
   Methods Eight FNAs of MAECs were identified and reviewed. A chart review
   for each case was conducted.
   Results All patients were male, 42-68 years of age, and presented with
   either Stage 3 or 4 disease. Smear backgrounds of all cases showed naked
   nuclei without significant necrosis. The smears were cellular with cells
   arranged in either three-dimensional (3D) clusters with intervening
   capillaries or singly dispersed. Acinar formation was a prominent
   feature. Cells were round to oval with small to moderate amounts of
   delicate cytoplasm. The nuclei were round to oval with mild to moderate
   anisonucleosis with granular chromatin and small nucleoli. Apoptotic
   bodies and mitoses were noted in most cases, with Ki67 indices of
   10\%-48\%. All tumors, by definition, demonstrated expression of trypsin
   and synaptophysin with variable chromogranin expression (50\%).
   Conclusion The cytology of acinar cell carcinoma shares features with
   aspirates of other nonductal adenocarcinoma neoplasms of the pancreas. A
   clue to the diagnosis is that tumors show high Ki67 indices and a
   diagnosis of MAEC should be excluded anytime a diagnosis of Grade 2 or 3
   well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumor or high-grade neuroendocrine
   carcinoma is in the differential.},

Abstract = {To separate replicated sister chromatids during mitosis, eukaryotes and
   prokaryotes have structural maintenance of chromosome (SMC) condensin
   complexes that were recently shown to organize chromosomes by a process
   known as DNA loop extrusion. In rapidly dividing bacterial cells, the
   process of separating sister chromatids occurs concomitantly with
   ongoing transcription. How transcription interferes with the condensin
   loop-extrusion process is largely unexplored, but recent experiments
   have shown that sites of high transcription may directionally affect
   condensin loop extrusion. We quantitatively investigate different
   mechanisms of interaction between condensin and elongating RNA
   polymerases (RNAPs) and find that RNAPs are likely steric barriers that
   can push and interact with condensins. Supported by chromosome
   conformation capture and chromatin immunoprecipitation for cells after
   transcription inhibition and RNAP degradation, we argue that
   translocating condensins must bypass transcribing RNAPs within similar
   to 1 to 2 s of an encounter at rRNA genes and within similar to 10 s at
   protein-coding genes. Thus, while individual RNAPs have little effect on
   the progress of loop extrusion, long, highly transcribed operons can
   significantly impede the extrusion process. Our data and quantitative
   models further suggest that bacterial condensin loop extrusion occurs by
   2 independent, uncoupled motor activities; the motors translocate on DNA
   in opposing directions and function together to enlarge chromosomal
   loops, each independently bypassing steric barriers in their path. Our
   study provides a quantitative link between transcription and 3D genome
   organization and proposes a mechanism of interactions between SMC
   complexes and elongating transcription machinery relevant from bacteria
   to higher eukaryotes.},

Abstract = {Using single and dual colour fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH)
   combined with image analysis techniques the topographic characteristics
   of genes and centromeres in nuclei of human colon tissue cells were
   investigated. The distributions of distances from the centre-of-nucleus
   to genes (centromeres) and from genes to genes (centromeres to
   centromeres) were studied in normal colon tissue cells found in the
   neighbourhood of tumour samples, in tumour cell line HT-29 and in
   promyelocytic HL-60 cell line for comparison. Our results show that the
   topography of genetic loci determined in 3D-fixed cell tissue
   corresponds to that obtained for 2D-fixed cells separated from the
   tissue. The distributions of the centre-of-nucleus to gene (centromere)
   distances and gene to gene (centromere to centromere) distances and
   their average values are different for various genetic loci but similar
   for normal colon tissue cells, HT-29 colon tumour cell line and HL-60
   promyelocytic cell line. It suggests that the arrangement of genetic
   loci in cell nucleus is conserved in different types of human cells. The
   investigations of trisomic loci in HT-29 cells revealed that the
   location of the third genetic element is not different from the location
   of two homologues in diploid cells. We have shown that the topographic
   parameters used in our experiments for different genetic elements are
   not tissue or tumour specific. In order to validate high-resolution
   cytometry for oncology, further investigations should include more
   precise parameters reflecting the state of chromatin in the
   neighbourhood of critical oncogenes or tumour suppresser genes.},

Abstract = {Mechanistic studies in erythroid cells indicate that LDB1, as part of a
   GATA1/TAL1/LMO2 complex, brings erythroid-expressed genes into proximity
   with enhancers for transcription activation. The role of co-activators
   in establishing this long-range interaction is poorly understood. Here
   we tested the contributions of the RNA Pol II pre-initiation complex
   (PIC), mediator and cohesin to establishment of locus control region
   (LCR)/beta-globin proximity. CRISPR/Cas9 editing of the beta-globin
   promoter to eliminate the RNA Pol II PIC by deleting the TATA-box
   resulted in loss of transcription, but enhancer-promoter interaction was
   unaffected. Additional deletion of the promoter GATA1 site eliminated
   LDB1 complex and mediator occupancy and resulted in loss of
   LCR/beta-globin proximity. To separate the roles of LDB1 and mediator in
   LCR looping, we expressed a looping-competent but
   transcription-activation deficient form of LDB1 in LDB1 knock down
   cells: LCR/beta-globin proximity was restored without mediator core
   occupancy. Further, Cas9-directed tethering of mutant LDB1 to the
   beta-globin promoter forced LCR loop formation in the absence of
   mediator or cohesin occupancy. Moreover, ENCODE data and our chromatin
   immunoprecipitation results indicate that cohesin is almost completely
   absent from validated and predicted LDB1-regulated erythroid
   enhancer-gene pairs. Thus, lineage specific factors largely mediate
   enhancer-promoter looping in erythroid cells independent of mediator and
   cohesin.},

Title = {Genetic/epigenetic effects in NF1 microdeletion syndrome: beyond the

Volume = {143},

Abstract = {NF1 microdeletion syndrome, accounting for 5-11\% of NF1 patients, is
   caused by a deletion in the NF1 region and it is generally characterized
   by a severe phenotype. Although 70\% of NF1 microdeletion patients
   presents the same 1.4 Mb type-I deletion, some patients may show
   additional clinical features. Therefore, the contribution of several
   pathogenic mechanisms, besides haploinsufficiency of some genes within
   the deletion interval, is expected and needs to be defined. We
   investigated an altered expression of deletion flanking genes by qPCR in
   patients with type-1 NF1 deletion, compared to healthy donors, possibly
   contributing to the clinical traits of NF1 microdeletion syndrome. In
   addition, the 1.4-Mb deletion leads to changes in the 3D chromatin
   structure in the 17q11.2 region. Specifically, this deletion alters
   DNA-DNA interactions in the regions flanking the breakpoints, as
   demonstrated by our 4C-seq analysis. This alteration likely causes
   position effect on the expression of deletion flanking
   genes.Interestingly, 4C-seq analysis revealed that in microdeletion
   patients, an interaction was established between the RHOT1 promoter and
   the SLC6A4 gene, which showed increased expression. We performed NGS on
   putative modifier genes, and identified two ``likely pathogenic{''} rare
   variants in RAS pathway, possibly contributing to incidental phenotypic
   features.This study provides new insights into understanding the
   pathogenesis of NF1 microdeletion syndrome and suggests a novel
   pathomechanism that contributes to the expression phenotype in addition
   to haploinsufficiency of genes located within the deletion.This is a
   pivotal approach that can be applied to unravel microdeletion syndromes,
   improving precision medicine, prognosis and patients' follow-up.},

Title = {Embryonic heat conditioning in chicks induces transgenerational
   heat/immunological resilience via methylation on regulatory elements},
Journal = {FASEB JOURNAL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {36},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The question of whether behavioral traits are heritable is under debate.
   An obstacle in demonstrating transgenerational inheritance in mammals
   originates from the maternal environment's effect on offspring
   phenotype. Here, we used in ovo embryonic heat conditioning (EHC) of
   first-generation chicks, demonstrating heredity of both heat and
   immunological resilience, confirmed by a reduced fibril response in
   their untreated offspring to either heat or LPS challenge. Concordantly,
   transcriptome analysis confirmed that EHC induces changes in gene
   expression in the anterior preoptic hypothalamus (APH) that contribute
   to these phenotypes in the offspring. To study the association between
   epigenetic mechanisms and trait heritability, DNA-methylation patterns
   in the APH of offspring of control versus EHC fathers were evaluated.
   Genome-wide analysis revealed thousands of differentially methylated
   sites (DMSs), which were highly enriched in enhancers and CCCTC-binding
   factor (CTCF) sites. Overlap analysis revealed 110 differentially
   expressed genes that were associated with altered methylation,
   predominantly on enhancers. Gene-ontology analysis shows pathways
   associated with immune response, chaperone-mediated protein folding, and
   stress response. For the proof of concept, we focused on HSP25 and
   SOCS3, modulators of heat and immune responses, respectively. Chromosome
   conformational capture (3C) assay identified interactions between their
   promoters and methylated enhancers, with the strongest frequency on CTCF
   binding sites. Furthermore, gene expression corresponded with the
   differential methylation patterns, and presented increased CTCF binding
   in both hyper- and hypomethylated DMSs. Collectively, we demonstrate
   that EHC induces transgenerational thermal and immunological resilience
   traits. We propose that one of the mechanisms underlying inheritance
   depends on three-dimensional (3D) chromatin reorganization.},

Title = {Oxyresveratrol drives caspase-independent apoptosis-like cell death in
   MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells through the induction of ROS},
Journal = {BIOCHEMICAL PHARMACOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {173},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Earlier studies from our laboratory have demonstrated that
   Oxyresveratrol (OXY), a hydroxyl-substituted stilbene, exhibits potent
   inhibition of human melanoma cell proliferation. The present study
   defines a cytotoxic effect of OXY on the highly chemo-resistant,
   triple-negative human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231. OXY-mediated
   cell death resulted in accumulation of cells at the sub-G1 phase of the
   cell cycle, induced chromatin condensation, DNA fragmentation,
   phosphatidylserine externalization and PARP cleavage, indicative of
   apoptosis. Interestingly, morphology and cell viability studies with the
   pan-caspase inhibitor, QVD-OPH revealed that OXY-induced cell death was
   caspase-independent. Docking studies also showed that OXY can bind to
   the S1 site of caspase-3, and could also exert an inhibitory effect on
   this executioner caspase. The immunoblot analysis demonstrating the
   absence of caspase cleavage during cell death further confirmed these
   findings. OXY was also observed to induce the production of reactive
   oxygen species, which caused the depolarization of the mitochondrial
   membrane resulting in translocation of Apoptosis Inducing Factor (AIF)
   into the nucleus. Pretreatment of the cells with N-Acetyl Cysteine
   antioxidant prevented cell death resulting from OXY treatment. Thus, OXY
   initiates ROS-mediated, apoptosis-like cell death, involving
   mitochondrial membrane depolarization, translocation of AIF into the
   nucleus, and DNA fragmentation, resulting in caspase-independent cell
   death in MDA-MB-231 cells. The cytotoxicity manifested by OXY was also
   observed in 3D cell culture models and primary cells, thereby providing
   a basis for the utilization of OXY as a novel template for the future
   design of anticancer therapeutics.},

Abstract = {Background Methods Bile duct brushing (BDB) cytology, for the
   characterization of bile duct strictures, can be challenging to
   interpret when associated with a stent. Our study aims to identify the
   cytologic criteria for the diagnosis of adenocarcinoma in BDBs in the
   presence of a stent. A database search (January 2010-December 2015)
   identified three groups of BDBs-negative with stent, malignant with
   stent, malignant without stent. All malignant cases had histologic
   and/or cytologic evidence of malignancy within 1 month of the brushing
   sample. All reactive cases had >= 6 months of benign clinical follow-up.
   ThinPrep slides were reviewed by two cytopathologists and cytologic
   features were recorded. Statistical analysis was performed using
   Fisher's exact test. Results Conclusion The study cohort included 12
   reactive cases with stent, 17 malignant cases with stent and 32
   malignant cases without stent. Among the stented cases, the cytologic
   features that reached statistical significance were 3D architecture,
   anisonucleosis to the extent of >= 1:6, coarse chromatin distribution
   and the presence of single atypical cells in the malignant group in
   contrast to the benign group. Cases that were diagnosed malignant in the
   presence of a stent revealed a spectrum of cell populations more
   frequently as compared with the malignant cases without stent (76\% vs
   16\%). Our findings reveal that the cytologic features of malignancy in
   non-stented BDBs mostly hold true for stented specimens as well.
   Application of these criteria in the presence of a stent can improve
   diagnostic accuracy and thereby patient care.},

Title = {Gemcitabine, vinorelbine and cyclooxygenase inhibitors in the treatment
   of glioblastoma. Ultrastructural analyses in C6 glioma <i>in vitro</i>},
Journal = {TISSUE \& CELL},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {59},
Pages = {18-32},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Objectives: To define ultrastructural features accompanying to antitumor
   effects of gemcitabine, vinorelbine and cyclooxygenase inhibitors in C6
   glioma cells in vitro. Vinorelbine is a semisynthetic vinca alkaloid and
   recent studies showed its antitumor activity in pediatric optic and
   pontine gliomas. Vinorelbine infusion induces a severe tumor site-pain
   in systemic cancers, but it is unknown whether algesia and inflammation
   contribute to its antitumor effects. Gemcitabine is a
   nucleoside-chemotherapeutic which was recently shown to act as a
   radiosensitizer in high-grade glioma. Some studies showed synergism of
   anti-inflammatory cyclooxygenase-inhibitors with microtubule inhibitors
   and gemcitabine. DMSO is a solvent and blocks both cylooxygenase and
   ribonucleotide reductase, another target of gemcitabine. Rofecoxib is
   withdrawn from the market, yet we used it for investigational purposes,
   since it blocks cylooxygenase-2 1000-times more potently than
   cylooxygenase-1 and is also a selective inhibitor of crinophagy.
   Methods: Plating efficacy, 3D-spheroid S-phase analysis with BrdU
   labelling and transmission electron micro-scopical analyses were
   performed.
   Results: Vinorelbine induced frequent mitotic slippage/apoptosis and
   autophagy. Despite both DMSO and rofecoxib induced autophagy alone and
   in synergy, they reduced mitotic catastrophe and autophagy triggered by
   vinorelbine, which was also reflected by reduced inhibition of spheroid
   S-phase. Gemcitabine induced karyolysis and margination of coarse
   chromatin towards the nuclear membrane, abundant autophagy, gutta adipis
   formation and decrease in mitochondria, which were enhanced by DMSO and
   rofecoxib.
   Conclusions: Detailed ultrastructural analysis of the effects of
   chemotherapeutic drugs may provide a broader insight about their actions
   and pave to develop better strategies in treatment of glioblastoma.},

Title = {Kinetics of <i>Xist</i>-induced gene silencing can be predicted from

Volume = {29},

Abstract = {To initiate X-Chromosome inactivation (XCI), the long noncoding RNA Xist
   mediates chromosome-wide gene silencing of one X Chromosome in female
   mammals to equalize gene dosage between the sexes. The efficiency of
   gene silencing is highly variable across genes, with some genes even
   escaping XCI in somatic cells. A gene's susceptibility to Xist-mediated
   silencing appears to be determined by a complex interplay of epigenetic
   and genomic features; however, the underlying rules remain poorly
   understood. We have quantified chromosome-wide gene silencing kinetics
   at the level of the nascent transcriptome using allele-specific
   Precision nuclear Run-On sequencing (PRO-seq). We have developed a
   Random Forest machine-learning model that can predict the measured
   silencing dynamics based on a large set of epigenetic and genomic
   features and tested its predictive power experimentally. The genomic
   distance to the Xist locus, followed by gene density and distance to
   LINE elements, are the prime determinants of the speed of gene
   silencing. Moreover, we find two distinct gene classes associated with
   different silencing pathways: a class that requires Xist-repeat A for
   silencing, which is known to activate the SPEN pathway, and a second
   class in which genes are premarked by Polycomb complexes and tend to
   rely on the B repeat in Xist for silencing, known to recruit Polycomb
   complexes during XCI. Moreover, a series of features associated with
   active transcriptional elongation and chromatin 3D structure are
   enriched at rapidly silenced genes. Our machine-learning approach can
   thus uncover the complex combinatorial rules underlying gene silencing
   during X inactivation.},

Title = {Chrysotile effects on human lung cell carcinoma in culture: 3-D
   reconstruction and DNA quantification by image analysis},
Journal = {BMC CANCER},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {8},
Month = {JUN 27},
Abstract = {Background: Chrysotile is considered less harmful to human health than
   other types of asbestos fibers. Its clearance from the lung is faster
   and, in comparison to amphibole forms of asbestos, chrysotile asbestos
   fail to accumulate in the lung tissue due to a mechanism involving
   fibers fragmentation in short pieces. Short exposure to chrysotile has
   not been associated with any histopathological alteration of lung
   tissue.
   Methods: The present work focuses on the association of small chrysotile
   fibers with interphasic and mitotic human lung cancer cells in culture,
   using for analyses confocal laser scanning microscopy and 3D
   reconstructions. The main goal was to perform the analysis of
   abnormalities in mitosis of fibers-containing cells as well as to
   quantify nuclear DNA content of treated cells during their recovery in
   fiber-free culture medium.
   Results: HK2 cells treated with chrysotile for 48 h and recovered in
   additional periods of 24, 48 and 72 h in normal medium showed increased
   frequency of multinucleated and apoptotic cells. DNA ploidy of the cells
   submitted to the same chrysotile treatment schedules showed enhanced
   aneuploidy values. The results were consistent with the high frequency
   of multipolar spindles observed and with the presence of fibers in the
   intercellular bridge during cytokinesis.
   Conclusion: The present data show that 48 h chrysotile exposure can
   cause centrosome amplification, apoptosis and aneuploid cell formation
   even when long periods of recovery were provided. Internalized fibers
   seem to interact with the chromatin during mitosis, and they could also
   interfere in cytokinesis, leading to cytokinesis failure which forms
   aneuploid or multinucleated cells with centrosome amplification.},

Title = {Identification and characterization of Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1
   interacting proteins during development of <i>Dictyostelium
   discoideum</i>},
Journal = {PROTEIN EXPRESSION AND PURIFICATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {186},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) is a multifunctional protein
   that is associated with various biological processes like chromatin
   remodeling, DNA damage, cell death etc. In Dictyostelium discoideum,
   PARP-1 has also been implicated in cellular differentiation and
   development. However, its interacting proteins during multicellular
   development are not yet explored. Hence, the present study aims to
   identify PARP-1 interacting proteins during multicellular development of
   D. discoideum.
   BRCA1 C-terminus (BRCT) domain of PARP-1, which is mainly involved in
   protein-protein interactions was cloned in pGEX4T1 vector and
   developmental interactome of PARP-1 were analyzed by affinity
   purification-mass spectrometry. These interactions were further
   confirmed by in-silico protein-protein docking analysis, which led to
   identification of the proteins that show high affinity for BRCT domain.
   Initially, the protein structures were modeled on SWISS MODEL and PHYRE2
   servers, refined by 3D-refine and validated by PROCHECK. Further,
   interaction sites of BRCT and the conserved regions in all interacting
   proteins were predicted using cons-PPISP and ConSurf, respectively.
   Finally, protein-protein docking analysis was done by HADDOCK.
   Our results identified 19 possible BRCT interacting proteins during D.
   discoideum development. Furthermore, interacting residues involved in
   the interactions and functional regions were explored. This is the first
   report where PARP-1's developmental interactome in D. discoideum is well
   established. The current findings demonstrate PARP-1's developmental
   interactome in D. discoideum and provide the groundwork to understand
   its regulated functions in developmental biology which would undoubtedly
   extend our perception towards developmental diseases in higher complex
   organisms and their treatment.},

Abstract = {Cancer studies primarily focus on the characterization of the key driver
   genes and the underlying pathways. However, the contribution of other
   cancer-associated genes located in the genomic neighborhood of the
   driver genes could help to understand further aspects of cancer
   progression. Given the frequent involvement of chromosome 3 in multiple
   human cancers, in particular in the form of the prognostically highly
   relevant monosomy 3 in uveal melanoma (UM), we investigated the
   cumulative impact of cancer-associated genes on chromosome 3. Our
   analysis showed that these genes are enriched with repetitive elements
   with genes surrounded by distinctive repeats (MIR, hAT-Charlie,
   ERVL-MaLR, LINE-2, and simple/low complexity) in the promoter being more
   precisely associated with cancer-related pathways than the ones with
   major transposable elements (SINE/Alu and LINE-1). Additionally, these
   genes showed strong intrachromosomal chromatin interactions in 3D
   nuclear organization. Further investigations revealed a genomic hotspot
   in the vicinity of BAP1 locus, which is affected in 27 types of
   different cancers and contains abundant noncoding RNAs that are often
   expressed in a tissue-specific manner. The cross-species comparison of
   these cancer-associated genes revealed mostly a shared synteny in closer
   primates. However, near to the BAP1 locus signs of chromosomal
   inversions were observed during the course of evolution. To our
   knowledge, this is the first study to characterize the entire genomic
   neighborhood of cancer-associated genes located on any single
   chromosome. Based on our results, we hypothesize that monosomy of
   chromosome 3 will have important clinical and molecular consequences in
   the respective diseases and in particular in UM.},

Abstract = {Chromosomes were discovered more than 130 years ago. The implementation
   of chromosomal investigations in clinical diagnostics was fueled by
   determining the correct number of human chromosomes to be 46 and the
   development of specific banding techniques. Subsequent technical
   improvements in the field of genetic diagnostics, such as fluorescence
   in situ hybridization (FISH), chromosomal microarrays (CMA, array CGH)
   or next-generation sequencing (NGS) techniques, partially succeeded in
   overcoming limitations of banding cytogenetics. Consequently, nowadays,
   higher diagnostic yields can be achieved if new approaches such as NGS,
   CMA or FISH are applied in combination with cytogenetics. Nonetheless,
   high-resolution DNA-focused techniques have dominated clinical
   diagnostics more recently, rather than a ``chromosomic view,{''}
   including banding cytogenetics as a precondition for the application of
   higher resolution methods. Currently, there is a renaissance of this
   ``chromosomic view{''} in research, understanding chromosomes to be an
   essential feature of genomic architecture, owing to the discovery of (i)
   higher order chromosomal sub-compartments, (ii) chromosomal features
   that influence genomic architecture, gene expression, and evolution, and
   (iii) 3D and 4D chromatin organization within the nucleus, including the
   complex way in which chromosomes interact with each other.
   Interestingly, in many instances research was triggered by specific
   clinical diagnostic cases or diseases that contributed to new and
   fascinating insights, not only into disease mechanisms but also into
   basic principles of chromosome biology. Here we review the role, the
   intrinsic value, and the perspectives of chromosomes in a molecular
   genetics-dominated human genetics diagnostic era and make comparison
   with basic research, where these benefits are well-recognized.},

Abstract = {Nuclear receptors (NRs) comprise a family of 49 members that share a
   common structural organization and act as ligand-inducible transcription
   factors with major (patho)physiological impact. For some NRs ({''}orphan
   receptors{''}), cognate ligands have not yet been identified or may not
   exist. The principles of DNA recognition and ligand binding are well
   understood from both biochemical and crystal structure analyses. The 3D
   structures of several DNA-binding domains (DBDs), in complexes with a
   variety of cognate response elements, and multiple ligand-binding
   domains (LBDs), in the absence (apoLBD) and presence (holoLBD) of
   agonist, have been established and reveal canonical structural
   organization. Agonist binding induces a structural transition in the LBD
   whose most striking feature is the relocation of helix H12, which is
   required for establishing a coactivator complex, through interaction
   with members of the p160 family (SRC1, TIF2, AIB1) and/or the TRAP/DRIP
   complex. The p160-dependent coactivator complex is a multiprotein
   complex that comprises histone acetyltransferases (HATs), such as CBP,
   methyltransferases, such as CARM1, and other enzymes (SUMO ligase,
   etc.). The agonist-dependent recruitment of the HAT complex results in
   chromatin modification in the environment of the target gene promoters,
   which is requisite to, or may in some cases be sufficient for,
   transcription activation. In the absence of ligands, or in the presence
   of some antagonists, certain NRs are bound to distinct multiprotein
   complexes through the interaction with corepressors, such as NCoR and
   SMRT. Corepressor complexes comprise histone deacetylases (HDACs) that
   have the capacity to condense chromatin over target gene promoters.
   Ligands have been designed that selectively modulate the interaction
   between NRs and their coregulators. Both HATs and HDACs can also modify
   the acetylation status of nonhistone proteins, but the significance in
   the context of NR signaling is unclear. NRs communicate with other
   intracellular signaling pathways on a mutual basis, and their
   functionality may be altered, positively or negatively, by
   post-translational modification. The majority of NRs act as retinoid X
   receptor (RXR) heterodimers in which RXR cannot a priori respond
   autonomously to its cognate ligand to activate target gene
   transcription. This RXR subordination allows signaling pathway identity
   for the RXR partner. The corresponding mechanism is understood and
   reveals cell and NR selectivity, indicating that RXR can, under certain
   conditions, act autonomously. NRs are regulators of cell life and death,
   and NR malfunction can be at the basis of both disease and therapy, as
   is impressively documented in the case of acute promyelocytic leukemia.
   Recently, several pathways have been uncovered that link NR action with
   cell proliferation and apoptosis.},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Background: Prioritizing tag-SNPs carried on extended risk haplotypes at
   susceptibility loci for common disease is a challenge. Methods: We
   utilized trans-ancestral exclusion mapping to reduce risk haplotypes at
   IKZF1 and IKZF3 identified in multiple ancestries from SLE GWAS and
   ImmunoChip datasets. We characterized functional annotation data across
   each risk haplotype from publicly available datasets including ENCODE,
   RoadMap Consortium, PC Hi-C data from 3D genome browser, NESDR NTR
   conditional eQTL database, GeneCards Genehancers and TF (transcription
   factor) binding sites from Haploregv4. Results: We refined the 60 kb
   associated haplotype upstream of IKZF1 to just 12 tag-SNPs tagging a
   47.7 kb core risk haplotype. There was preferential enrichment of DNAse
   I hypersensitivity and H3K27ac modification across the 3 ` end of the
   risk haplotype, with four tag-SNPs sharing allele-specific TF binding
   sites with promoter variants, which are eQTLs for IKZF1 in whole blood.
   At IKZF3, we refined a core risk haplotype of 101 kb (27 tag-SNPs) from
   an initial extended haplotype of 194 kb (282 tag-SNPs), which had
   widespread DNAse I hypersensitivity, H3K27ac modification and multiple
   allele-specific TF binding sites. Dimerization of Fox family TFs bound
   at the 3 ` and promoter of IKZF3 may stabilize chromatin looping across
   the locus. Conclusions: We combined trans-ancestral exclusion mapping
   and epigenetic annotation to identify variants at both IKZF1 and IKZF3
   with the highest likelihood of biological relevance. The approach will
   be of strong interest to other complex trait geneticists seeking to
   attribute biological relevance to risk alleles on extended risk
   haplotypes in their disease of interest.},

Abstract = {Background DNA replication in mammalian cells occurs in a defined
   temporal order during S phase, known as the replication timing (RT)
   programme. Replication timing is developmentally regulated and
   correlated with chromatin conformation and local transcriptional
   potential. Here, we present RT profiles of unprecedented temporal
   resolution in two human embryonic stem cell lines, human colon carcinoma
   line HCT116, and mouse embryonic stem cells and their neural progenitor
   derivatives. Results Fine temporal windows revealed a remarkable degree
   of cell-to-cell conservation in RT, particularly at the very beginning
   and ends of S phase, and identified 5 temporal patterns of replication
   in all cell types, consistent with varying degrees of initiation
   efficiency. Zones of replication initiation (IZs) were detected
   throughout S phase and interacted in 3D space preferentially with other
   IZs of similar firing time. Temporal transition regions were resolved
   into segments of uni-directional replication punctuated at specific
   sites by small, inefficient IZs. Sites of convergent replication were
   divided into sites of termination or large constant timing regions
   consisting of many synchronous IZs in tandem. Developmental transitions
   in RT occured mainly by activating or inactivating individual IZs or
   occasionally by altering IZ firing time, demonstrating that IZs, rather
   than individual origins, are the units of developmental regulation.
   Finally, haplotype phasing revealed numerous regions of allele-specific
   and allele-independent asynchronous replication. Allele-independent
   asynchronous replication was correlated with the presence of previously
   mapped common fragile sites. Conclusions Altogether, these data provide
   a detailed temporal choreography of DNA replication in mammalian cells.},

Title = {The Role of Polycomb Proteins in Cell Lineage Commitment and Embryonic
   Development},
Journal = {EPIGENOMES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {6},
Number = {3},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Embryonic development is a highly intricate and complex process.
   Different regulatory mechanisms cooperatively dictate the fate of cells
   as they progress from pluripotent stem cells to terminally
   differentiated cell types in tissues. A crucial regulator of these
   processes is the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2). By catalyzing the
   mono-, di-, and tri-methylation of lysine residues on histone H3 tails
   (H3K27me3), PRC2 compacts chromatin by cooperating with Polycomb
   Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1) and represses transcription of target genes.
   Proteomic and biochemical studies have revealed two variant complexes of
   PRC2, namely PRC2.1 which consists of the core proteins (EZH2, SUZ12,
   EED, and RBBP4/7) interacting with one of the Polycomb-like proteins
   (MTF2, PHF1, PHF19), and EPOP or PALI1/2, and PRC2.2 which contains
   JARID2 and AEBP2 proteins. MTF2 and JARID2 have been discovered to have
   crucial roles in directing and recruiting PRC2 to target genes for
   repression in embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Following these findings,
   recent work in the field has begun to explore the roles of different
   PRC2 variant complexes during different stages of embryonic development,
   by examining molecular phenotypes of PRC2 mutants in both in vitro (2D
   and 3D differentiation) and in vivo (knock-out mice) assays, analyzed
   with modern single-cell omics and biochemical assays. In this review, we
   discuss the latest findings that uncovered the roles of different PRC2
   proteins during cell-fate and lineage specification and extrapolate
   these findings to define a developmental roadmap for different flavors
   of PRC2 regulation during mammalian embryonic development.},

Abstract = {Topological constraints placed on short fragments of DNA change the
   disorder found in chain molecules randomly decorated by nonspecific,
   architectural proteins into tightly organized 3D structures. The
   bacterial heat-unstable (HU) protein builds up, counter to expectations,
   in greater quantities and at particular sites along simulated DNA
   minicircles and loops. Moreover, the placement of HU along loops with
   the ``wild-type{''} spacing found in the Escherichia coli lactose (lac)
   and galactose (gal) operons precludes access to key recognition elements
   on DNA. The HU protein introduces a unique spatial pathway in the DNA
   upon closure. The many ways in which the protein induces nearly the same
   closed circular configuration point to the statistical advantage of its
   nonspecificity. The rotational settings imposed on DNA by the repressor
   proteins, by contrast, introduce sequential specificity in HU placement,
   with the nonspecific protein accumulating at particular loci on the
   constrained duplex. Thus, an architectural protein with no discernible
   DNA sequence-recognizing features becomes site-specific and potentially
   assumes a functional role upon loop formation. The locations of HU on
   the closed DNA reflect long-range mechanical correlations. The protein
   responds to DNA shape and deformability-the stiff, naturally straight
   double-helical structure-rather than to the unique features of the
   constituent base pairs. The structures of the simulated loops suggest
   that HU architecture, like nucleosomal architecture, which modulates the
   ability of regulatory proteins to recognize their binding sites in the
   context of chromatin, may influence repressor-operator interactions in
   the context of the bacterial nucleoid.},

Title = {Predicting p53-dependent cell transitions from thermodynamic models},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {161},
Number = {13},
Month = {OCT 7},
Abstract = {A cell's fate involves transitions among its various states, each
   defined by a distinct gene expression profile governed by the topology
   of gene regulatory networks, which are affected by 3D genome
   organization. Here, we develop thermodynamic models to determine the
   fate of a malignant cell as governed by the tumor suppressor p53
   signaling network, taking into account long-range chromatin interactions
   in the mean-field approximation. The tumor suppressor p53 responds to
   stress by selectively triggering one of the potential transcription
   programs that influence many layers of cell signaling. These range from
   p53 phosphorylation to modulation of its DNA binding affinity, phase
   separation phenomena, and internal connectivity among cell fate genes.
   We use the minimum free energy of the system as a fundamental property
   of biological networks that influences the connection between the gene
   network topology and the state of the cell. We constructed models based
   on network topology and equilibrium thermodynamics. Our modeling shows
   that the binding of phosphorylated p53 to promoters of target genes can
   have properties of a first order phase transition. We apply our model to
   cancer cell lines ranging from breast cancer (MCF-7), colon cancer
   (HCT116), and leukemia (K562), with each one characterized by a specific
   network topology that determines the cell fate. Our results clarify the
   biological relevance of these mechanisms and suggest that they represent
   flexible network designs for switching between developmental decisions.

Abstract = {Potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) maturity involves several important
   traits, including the onset of tuberization, flowering, leaf senescence,
   and the length of the plant life cycle. The timing of flowering and
   tuberization in potato is mediated by seasonal fluctuations in
   photoperiod and is thought to be separately controlled by the FLOWERING
   LOCUS T-like (FT-like) genes SELF-PRUNING 3D (StSP3D) and SELF-PRUNING
   6A (StSP6A). However, the biological relationship between these
   morphological transitions that occur almost synchronously remains
   unknown. Here, we show that StABI5-like 1 (StABL1), a transcription
   factor central to abscisic acid (ABA) signaling, is a binding partner of
   StSP3D and StSP6A, forming an alternative florigen activation complex
   and alternative tuberigen activation complex in a 14-3-3-dependent
   manner. Overexpression of StABL1 results in the early initiation of
   flowering and tuberization as well as a short life cycle. Using
   genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing and RNA-sequencing,
   we demonstrate that AGAMOUS-like and GA 2-oxidase 1 genes are regulated
   by StABL1. Phytohormone profiling indicates an altered gibberellic acid
   (GA) metabolism and that StABL1-overexpressing plants are insensitive to
   the inhibitory effect of GA with respect to tuberization. Collectively,
   our results suggest that StABL1 functions with FT-like genes to promote
   flowering and tuberization and consequently life cycle length in potato,
   providing insight into the pleiotropic functioning of the FT gene.
   StABI5-like 1, a transcription factor central to ABA signaling,
   functions with FLOWERING LOCUS T-like proteins to promote early
   flowering, tuberization, and life cycle length in potato.},

Title = {Identification of ultrastructural signatures of sleep and wake in the
   fly brain},
Journal = {SLEEP},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {45},
Number = {5},
Month = {OCT 6},
Abstract = {The cellular consequences of sleep loss are poorly characterized. In the
   pyramidal neurons of mouse frontal cortex, we found that mitochondria
   and secondary lysosomes occupy a larger proportion of the cytoplasm
   after chronic sleep restriction compared to sleep, consistent with
   increased cellular burden due to extended wake. For each morphological
   parameter, the within-animal variance was high, suggesting that the
   effects of sleep and sleep loss vary greatly among neurons. However, the
   analysis was based on 4-5 mice/group and a single section/cell. Here, we
   applied serial block-face scanning electron microscopy to identify
   signatures of sleep and sleep loss in the Drosophila brain. Stacks of
   images were acquired and used to obtain full 3D reconstructions of the
   cytoplasm and nucleus of 263 Kenyon cells from adult flies collected
   after a night of sleep (S) or after 11 h (SD11) or 35 h (SD35) of sleep
   deprivation (9 flies/group). Relative to S flies, SD35 flies showed
   increased density of dark clusters of chromatin and Golgi apparata and a
   trend increase in the percent of cell volume occupied by mitochondria,
   consistent with increased need for energy and protein supply during
   extended wake. Logistic regression models could assign each neuron to
   the correct experimental group with good accuracy, but in each cell,
   nuclear and cytoplasmic changes were poorly correlated, and within-fly
   variance was substantial in all experimental groups. Together, these
   results support the presence of ultrastructural signatures of sleep and
   sleep loss but underscore the complexity of their effects at the
   single-cell level.},

Abstract = {The functional application of RNA-guided CRISPR-associated Cas9 protein,
   a bacterial immune system-based protein complex, via which in vivo,
   highly specific, and well-regulated, gene-editing processes are being
   monitored at an unprecedented level, has led to remarkable progress in
   genetic engineering and technology. The complicated in vivo process of
   genome interrogation followed by gene editing by the Cas9 complex was
   recently reported by Knight et al. (Science, 2015, 350, 823-826) using
   an elegant single-particle tracking method, aided by the two-photon
   fluorescence correlation spectroscopic technique. In contrast to the
   usually observed fast target-searching and protein-binding events in
   biophysical systems, an interesting slow genome-interrogation process by
   the RNA-guided CRISPR-Cas9 system through a crowded chromatin
   environment of a mammalian cell has been revealed in Knight et al.'s
   study. Motivated by this experiment, in this paper, we provide a
   generalized theoretical framework to capture this particular
   target-searching mechanism of the CRISPR-Cas9 protein complex. We show
   that an analysis on the basis of 3D subdiffusion under a cylindrical
   volume, created by several nonspecific off-target interactions from the
   DNA strands, can capture the essential details of the process. Moreover,
   on the basis of this model, we quantify the dynamics of this process and
   estimate the survival probability, first passage time, and the intensity
   correlation function of the tagged proteins of the experiment. The
   results from our theoretical predictions are found to be consistent with
   the experimental observations, and hence, seem to provide a plausible
   microscopic picture of the process.},

Abstract = {Human endogenous retroviruses (HERV), a type of transposable elements
   (TE), play crucial roles in human placental morphogen-esis, immune
   response, and cancer progression. Emerging evidence suggests that TEs
   have been a rich source of regulatory elements in the human genome, but
   little is known about the global impact of HERVs on transcriptional
   networks in cancer. Using genome-wide approaches, we show that HERVs are
   composed primarily of three ancient superfamilies: ERVL-MaLR, ERVL, and
   ERV1. This anal-ysis suggests that the integration of exonic, intronic,
   and intergenic HERVs, as well as human or Hominidae gene-specific HERVs,
   contributes to human genomic innovation. HERVs exonized in genes are
   located mainly in the 30 untranslated region (UTR) or 30 end and
   participate in basic biological processes. Active HERVs are located
   mainly in intronic and intergenic regions and tend to function as
   enhancers and contribute to cancer cell type-specific gene expression.
   More importantly, HERVs may also define chro-matin topologically
   associating domain (TAD) and loop boundaries in a cell type-specific
   manner. Taken together, these findings reveal that ancient HERV elements
   are a source of diverse regulatory sequences, including 30 UTRs, 50
   UTRs, promoters, and enhancers, and they contribute to genetic
   innovation and cancer cell type- specific gene expression, highlighting
   the previously underesti-mated importance of these elements.
   Significance: Genome-wide analyses show that human endog-enous
   retroviruses mediate cancer cell type-specific gene expres-sion,
   epigenetic modification, and 3D chromatin architecture, elucidating the
   relationship between HERVs and diverse cancers.},

Abstract = {During embryonic brain development, neurogenesis requires the
   orchestration of gene expression to regulate neural stem cell (NSC) fate
   specification. Epigenetic regulation with specific emphasis on the modes
   of histone variants and histone post-translational modifications are
   involved in interactive gene regulation of central nervous system (CNS)
   development. Here, we provide a broad overview of the regulatory system
   of histone variants and histone modifications that have been linked to
   neurogenesis and diseases. We also review the crosstalk between
   different histone modifications and discuss how the 3D genome affects
   cell fate dynamics during brain development. Understanding the
   mechanisms of epigenetic regulation in neurogenesis has shifted the
   paradigm from single gene regulation to synergistic interactions to
   ensure healthy embryonic neurogenesis.},

Title = {Diurnal oscillations of epigenetic modifications are associated with
   variation in rhythmic expression of homoeologous genes in <i>Brassica
   napus</i>},
Journal = {BMC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {21},
Number = {1},
Month = {OCT 31},
Abstract = {Background Epigenetic modifications that exhibit circadian oscillations
   also promote circadian oscillations of gene expression. Brassica napus
   is a heterozygous polyploid species that has undergone distant
   hybridization and genome doubling events and has a young and distinct
   species origin. Studies incorporating circadian rhythm analysis of
   epigenetic modifications can offer new insights into differences in
   diurnal oscillation behavior among subgenomes and the regulation of
   diverse expressions of homologous gene rhythms in biological
   clocks.Results In this study, we created a high-resolution and
   multioscillatory gene expression dataset, active histone modification
   (H3K4me3, H3K9ac), and RNAPII recruitment in Brassica napus. We also
   conducted the pioneering characterization of the diurnal rhythm of
   transcription and epigenetic modifications in an allopolyploid species.
   We compared the evolution of diurnal rhythms between subgenomes and
   observed that the Cn subgenome had higher diurnal oscillation activity
   in both transcription and active histone modifications than the An
   subgenome. Compared to the A subgenome in Brassica rapa, the An
   subgenome of Brassica napus displayed significant changes in diurnal
   oscillation characteristics of transcription. Homologous gene pairs
   exhibited a higher proportion of diurnal oscillation in transcription
   than subgenome-specific genes, attributed to higher chromatin
   accessibility and abundance of active epigenetic modification types. We
   found that the diurnal expression of homologous genes displayed
   diversity, and the redundancy of the circadian system resulted in
   extensive changes in the diurnal rhythm characteristics of clock genes
   after distant hybridization and genome duplication events. Epigenetic
   modifications influenced the differences in the diurnal rhythm of
   homologous gene expression, and the diurnal oscillation of homologous
   gene expression was affected by the combination of multiple histone
   modifications.Conclusions Herein, we presented, for the first time, a
   characterization of the diurnal rhythm characteristics of gene
   expression and its epigenetic modifications in an allopolyploid species.
   Our discoveries shed light on the epigenetic factors responsible for the
   diurnal oscillation activity imbalance between subgenomes and homologous
   genes' rhythmic expression differences. The comprehensive time-series
   dataset we generated for gene expression and epigenetic modifications
   provides a valuable resource for future investigations into the
   regulatory mechanisms of protein-coding genes in Brassica napus.},

Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},

Abstract = {The integration of genetic information in the cellular and nuclear
   environments is crucial for deciphering the way in which the genome
   functions under different physiological conditions. Experimental
   techniques of 3D nuclear mapping, a high-flow approach such as
   transcriptomic data analyses, and statistical methods for the
   development of co-expressed gene networks, can be combined to develop an
   integrated approach for depicting the regulation of gene expression. Our
   work focused more specifically on the mechanisms involved in the
   transcriptional regulation of genes expressed in muscle during late
   foetal development in pig. The data generated by a transcriptomic
   analysis carried out on muscle of foetuses from two extreme genetic
   lines for birth mortality are used to construct networks of
   differentially expressed and co-regulated genes. We developed an
   innovative co-expression networking approach coupling, by means of an
   iterative process, a new statistical method for graph inference with
   data of gene spatial co-localization (3D DNA FISH) to construct a robust
   network grouping co-expressed genes. This enabled us to highlight
   relevant biological processes related to foetal muscle maturity and to
   discover unexpected gene associations between IGF2, MYH3 and DLK1/MEG3
   in the nuclear space, genes that are up-regulated at this stage of
   muscle development.},

Abstract = {Chromosomes in human spermatozoa are arranged non-randomly with the
   centromeres of non-homologous chromosomes forming a chromocenter. We
   have compared motile and immotile sperm populations in normozoospermic
   patients to determine if there is any dissimilarity in the formation of
   the chromocenter and the nuclear position of chromosome 17. Based on the
   differences between motile and immotile populations, we propose for the
   `optimal' nuclear organization to be defined as containing 1 to 3
   chromocenter(s) with central radial and median longitudinal position for
   the centromere of chromosome 17. By this definition, 42\% of motile
   spermatozoa had `optima' nuclei, in comparison to 25\% of immotile
   spermatozoa (P < 0.05). Immotile spermatozoa exhibited a greater
   disruption in the formation of the chromocenter, altered position of the
   centromere of chromosome 17, and were more prone to chemical
   decondensation, resulting in higher nuclear and chromocenter volumes.
   The altered topology of the chromosomes might lead to the disruption of
   the sequence of events involved in fertilization and early embryonic
   development.},

   conformation capture and 3D imaging, and function using RNA-sequencing.
   We introduce a quantitative index that measures underlying topological
   stability of a genomic region. Our results show that structural features
   of genomic regions correlate with function with surprising persistence
   over time. Furthermore, constructing genome-wide gene-level contact maps
   aided in identifying gene pairs with high potential for coregulation and
   colocalization in a manner consistent with expression via transcription
   factories. We additionally use 2D phase planes to visualize patterns in
   4DN data. Finally, we evaluated gene pairs within a circadian gene
   module using 3D imaging, and found periodicity in the movement of clock
   circadian regulator and period circadian clock 2 relative to each other

Abstract = {The human genome is intertwined, folded, condensed, and gradually
   constitutes the 3D architecture, thereby affecting transcription and
   widely involving in tumorigenesis. Incidence and mortality rates for
   orphan cancers increase due to poor early diagnosis and lack of
   effective medical treatments, which are now getting attention. Indepth
   understanding in tumorigenesis has fast-tracked over the last decade,
   however, the further role and mechanism of 3D genome organization in
   variant orphan tumorigenesis remains to be fully understood. We
   summarize for the first time that higher-order genome organization can
   provide novel insights into the occurrence mechanisms of orphan cancers,
   and discuss probable future research directions for drug development and
   anti-tumor therapies.},

Title = {TULIPs decorate the three-dimensional genome of PFA ependymoma},
Journal = {CELL},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {187},
Number = {18},
Month = {SEP 5},
Abstract = {Posterior fossa group A (PFA) ependymoma is a lethal brain cancer
   diagnosed in infants and young children. The lack of driver events in
   the PFA linear genome led us to search its 3D genome for characteristic
   features. Here, we reconstructed 3D genomes from diverse childhood tumor
   types and uncovered a global topology PFA that is highly reminiscent of
   stem and progenitor cells in a variety of human tissues. A remarkable
   feature exclusively present in PFA are type B ultra long-range
   interactions in PFAs (TULIPs), regions separated by great distances
   along the linear genome that interact with each other in the 3D nuclear
   space with surprising strength. TULIPs occur in all PFA samples and
   recur at predictable genomic coordinates, and their formation is induced
   by expression of EZHIP. The universality of TULIPs across PFA samples
   suggests a conservation of molecular principles that could be exploited
   therapeutically.},

Abstract = {Early disease diagnosis is key to the effective treatment of diseases.
   Histopathological analysis of human biopsies is the gold standard to
   diagnose tissue alterations. However, this approach has low resolution
   and overlooks 3D (three-dimensional) structural changes resulting from
   functional alterations. Here, we applied multiphoton imaging, 3D digital
   reconstructions and computational simulations to generate spatially
   resolved geometrical and functional models of human liver tissue at
   different stages of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). We
   identified a set of morphometric cellular and tissue parameters
   correlated with disease progression, and discover profound topological
   defects in the 3D bile canalicular (BC) network. Personalized biliary
   fluid dynamic simulations predicted an increased pericentral biliary
   pressure and micro-cholestasis, consistent with elevated cholestatic
   biomarkers in patients' sera. Our spatially resolved models of human
   liver tissue can contribute to high-definition medicine by identifying
   quantitative multiparametric cellular and tissue signatures to define
   disease progression and provide new insights into NAFLD pathophysiology.},

Abstract = {It is well known that the chromosomes are organized in the nucleus and
   this spatial arrangement of genome play a crucial role in gene
   regulation and genome stability. Different techniques have been
   developed and applied to uncover the intrinsic mechanism of genome
   architecture, especially the chromosome conformation capture (3C) and
   3C-derived methods. 3C and 3C-derived techniques provide us approaches
   to perform high-throughput chromatin architecture assays at the genome
   scale. However, the advantage and disadvantage of current methodologies
   of C-technologies have not been discussed extensively. In this review,
   we described and compared the methodologies of C-technologies used in
   genome organization studies with an emphasis on Hi-C method. We also
   discussed the crucial challenges facing current genome architecture
   studies based on 3C and 3C-derived technologies and the direction of
   future technologies to address currently outstanding questions in the
   field. These latest news contribute to our current understanding of
   genome structure, and provide a comprehensive reference for researchers
   to choose the appropriate method in future application. We consider that
   these constantly improving technologies will offer a finer and more
   accurate contact profiles of entire genome and ultimately reveal
   specific molecular machines govern its shape and function.},

Abstract = {During cell division, chromosomes are compacted in length by more than a
   100-fold. A wide range of experiments demonstrated that in their
   compacted state, mammalian chromosomes form arrays of closely stacked
   consecutive similar to 100 kb loops. The mechanism underlying the active
   process of chromosome compaction into a stack of loops is unknown. Here
   we test the hypothesis that chromosomes are compacted by enzymatic
   machines that actively extrude chromatin loops. When such loop-extruding
   factors (LEF) bind to chromosomes, they progressively bridge sites that
   are further away along the chromosome, thus extruding a loop. We
   demonstrate that collective action of LEFs leads to formation of a
   dynamic array of consecutive loops. Simulations and an analytically
   solved model identify two distinct steady states: a sparse state, where
   loops are highly dynamic but provide little compaction; and a dense
   state, where there are more stable loops and dramatic chromosome
   compaction. We find that human chromosomes operate at the border of the
   dense steady state. Our analysis also shows how the macroscopic
   characteristics of the loop array are determined by the microscopic
   properties of LEFs and their abundance. When the number of LEFs are used
   that match experimentally based estimates, the model can quantitatively
   reproduce the average loop length, the degree of compaction, and the
   general loop-array morphology of compact human chromosomes. Our study
   demonstrates that efficient chromosome compaction can be achieved solely
   by an active loop-extrusion process.},

Volume = {36},

Pages = {950-961},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Epigenetic mechanisms mediate genomic adaption to the environment and
   epigenetic alterations can contribute to the development of disease
   phenotypes, as can genetic variants. A variety of molecular mechanisms
   are involved in epigenetic regulation, including post-transcriptional
   histone modifications, histone variants, ATP-dependent chromatin
   remodelling complexes, polycomb/trithorax protein complexes, small and
   other noncoding RNAs (small interfering RNA and micro RNAs) and DNA
   methylation. Epigenetic mechanisms have been identified in cancer but
   very little is known about these effects in complex diseases such as
   asthma. Epigenetic mechanisms have been found to play a primordial role
   in T-cell differentiation and novel aspects of asthma and allergy
   development are now investigated by systematic epigenetic studies. Here
   we give an introduction to epigenetics, review the existing literature
   in relation to asthma and asthma-related mechanisms and hypothesise on
   feasible approaches for the study of epigenetics in asthma in the
   future.},

Abstract = {BackgroundTumor angiogenesis inhibitors have been applied for non-small
   cell lung cancer (NSCLC) therapy. However, the drug resistance hinders
   their further development. Intercellular crosstalk between lung cancer
   cells and vascular cells was crucial for anti-angiogenenic resistance
   (AAD). However, the understanding of this crosstalk is still
   rudimentary. Our previous study showed that Glioma-associated oncogene 1
   (Gli1) is a driver of NSCLC metastasis, but its role in lung cancer
   cell-vascular cell crosstalk remains unclear.MethodsConditioned medium
   (CM) from Gli1-overexpressing or Gli1-knockdown NSCLC cells was used to
   educate endothelia cells and pericytes, and the effects of these media
   on angiogenesis and the maturation of new blood vessels were evaluated
   via wound healing assays, Transwell migration and invasion assays, tube
   formation assays and 3D coculture assays. The xenograft model was
   conducted to establish the effect of Gli1 on tumor angiogenesis and
   growth. Angiogenic antibody microarray analysis, ELISA, luciferase
   reporte, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), bFGF protein stability
   and ubiquitination assay were performed to explore how Gli1 regulate
   bFGF expression.ResultsGli1 overexpression in NSCLC cells enhanced the
   endothelial cell and pericyte motility required for angiogenesis
   required for angiogenesis. However, Gli1 knockout in NSCLC cells had
   opposite effect on this process. bFGF was critical for the enhancement
   effect on tumor angiogenesis. bFGF treatment reversed the Gli1
   knockdown-mediated inhibition of angiogenesis. Mechanistically, Gli1
   increased the bFGF protein level by promoting bFGF transcriptional
   activity and protein stability. Importantly, suppressing Gli1 with
   GANT-61 obviously inhibited angiogenesis.ConclusionThe Gli1-bFGF axis is
   crucial for the crosstalk between lung cancer cells and vascular cells.
   Targeting Gli1 is a potential therapeutic approach for NSCLC
   angiogenesis.},

Abstract = {The dynamics of DNA and RNA structures in live cells are important for
   understanding cell behaviors, such as transcription activity, protein
   expression, cell apoptosis, and hereditary disease, but are challenging
   to monitor in live organisms in real time. The difficulty is largely due
   to the lack of photostable imaging probes that can distinguish between
   DNA and RNA, and more importantly, are capable of crossing multiple
   membrane barriers ranging from the cell/organelle to the tissue/organ
   level. We report the discovery of a cationic carbon quantum dot (cQD)
   probe that emits spectrally distinguishable fluorescence upon binding
   with double-stranded DNA and single-stranded RNA in live cells, thereby
   enabling real-time monitoring of DNA and RNA localization and motion. A
   surprising finding is that the probe can penetrate through various types
   of biological barriers invitro and invivo. Combined with standard and
   super-resolution microscopy, photostable cQDs allow time-lapse imaging
   of chromatin and nucleoli during cell division and Caenorhabditis

Abstract = {Aims Congenital myasthenic syndromes (CMS) are characterized by muscle
   weakness, ptosis and episodic apnoea. Mutations affect integral protein
   components of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ). Here we searched for the
   genetic basis of CMS in female monozygotic twins.
   Methods We employed whole-exome sequencing for mutation detection and
   Sanger sequencing for segregation analysis. Immunohistology was done
   with antibodies against CHD8, rapsyn, beta-catenin (beta CAT) and golgin
   on fi-bro-blasts, human and mouse muscle. We recorded superresolution
   images of the NMJ using 3D-structured illumination microscopy.
   Results We discovered a spontaneous missense mutation in CHD8
   {[}chr14:g.21,884,051G>A, GRCh37.p11 | c.1732C>T, NM\_00117062 |
   p.(R578C)], the gene encoding chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein
   8. This is the first missense mutation affecting Duplin, the short 110
   kDa isoform of CHD8. It is known that CHD8/Duplin negatively regulates
   beta CAT signalling in the WNT pathway and plays a role in chromatin
   remodelling. Inactivating CHD8 mutations are associated with autism
   spectrum disorder and intellectual disability in combination with facial
   dysmorphism, overgrowth and macrocephalus. No muscle-specific phenotype
   has been reported to date. Co-immunostaining with rapsyn on human and
   mouse muscle revealed a strong presence of CHD8 at the NMJ being located
   towards the sarcoplasmic side of the rapsyn cluster, where it
   co-localizes with beta CAT.
   Conclusion We hypothesize CHD8 to have a role in the maintenance of the
   structural integrity and function of the NMJ. Both patients benefited
   from treatment with 3,4-diaminopyridine, a reversible blocker of
   voltage-gated potassium channels at the nerve terminal that prolongs the
   action potential and increases acetylcholine release.},

Abstract = {Deregulation of the transforming growth factor beta (TGF beta) signal
   transduction cascade is functionally linked to cancer. In early phases,
   TGFb acts as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting tumor cell proliferation,
   whereas in late phases, it can act as a tumor promoter by stimulating
   tumor cell invasion and metastasis. Smad transcriptional effectors
   mediate TGF beta responses, but relatively little is known about the
   Smad-containing complexes that are important for epithelial-mesenchymal
   transition and invasion. In this study, we have tested the hypothesis
   that specific members of the AP-1 transcription factor family determine
   TGF beta signaling specificity in breast cancer cell invasion. Using a
   3D model of collagen-embedded spheroids of MCF10A-MII premalignant human
   breast cancer cells, we identified the AP-1 transcription factor
   components c-Jun, JunB, c-Fos and Fra1 as essential factors for TGF
   beta-induced invasion and found that various mesenchymal and
   invasion-associated TGF beta-induced genes are co-regulated by these
   proteins. In situ proximity ligation assays showed that TGF beta
   signaling not only induces complexes between Smad3 and Smad4 in the
   nucleus but also complexes between Smad2/3 and Fra1, whereas complexes
   between Smad3, c-Jun and JunB could already be detected before TGF beta
   stimulation. Finally, chromatin immunoprecipitations showed that c-Jun,
   JunB and Fra1, but not c-Fos, are required for TGF beta-induced binding
   of Smad2/3 to the mmp-10 and pai-1 promoters. Together these results
   suggest that in particular formation of Smad2/3-Fra1 complexes may
   reflect activation of the Smad/AP-1-dependent TGF beta-induced invasion
   program.},

Abstract = {We have previously demonstrated that ultraviolet (UV) light is effective
   against a variety of cancer cells expressing fluorescent proteins in
   vivo as well as in vitro. In the present report, we compared the DNA
   damage repair (DDR) response of pancreatic cancer cells after UVB or UVC
   irradiation. The UV-induced DNA damage repair was imaged with green
   fluorescent protein (GFP) fused to the DDR-related chromatin-binding
   protein 53BP1 in MiaPaCa-2 human pancreatic cancer cells growing in 3D
   Gelfoam (R) histoculture and in superficial tumors grown in nude mice.
   53BP1-GFP forms foci during DNA damage repair. A clonogenic assay in 2D
   monolayer culture initially showed that UVC and UVB inhibited MiaPaCa-2
   cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner, with UVC having more
   efficacy. Three-dimensional Gelfoam (R) histocultures and confocal
   imaging enabled 53BP1-GFP foci to be observed within 1 h after UV
   irradiation, indicating the onset of DDR response. UVB-induced 53BP1-GFP
   focus formation was observed up to a depth of 120 mu m in MiaPaCa-2
   cells on Gelfoam (R) compared to 80 mu m for UVC. UVB-induced 53BP1-GFP
   focus formation was observed up to a depth of 80 mu m in MiaPaCa-2
   cells, implanted within skin flaps in mice, at a significantly greater
   extent than UVC. MiaPaCa-2 cells irradiated by UVB or UVC in the
   skin-flap mouse model had a significant decrease in tumor growth
   compared to untreated controls with UVB having more efficacy than UVC.
   Our results demonstrate that UVB has greater tissue penetration than UVC
   because of its longer wavelength and has clinical potential for
   eradicating superficial cancer. (C) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Title = {Investigating the structural and functional consequences of germline
   single nucleotide polymorphisms located in the genes of the alternative
   lengthening of telomere (ALT) pathway},
Journal = {HELIYON},

Abstract = {Background: The Alternative Lengthening of Telomeres (ALT) pathway
   represents a non-canonical mechanism of telomere maintenance that
   operates independently of the conventional telomerase activity. The
   three biologically significant proteins, designated as SMARCAL1
   (SWI/SNF-related matrix-associated actin-dependent regulator of
   chromatin subfamily A-like protein 1), DAXX (Death domain-associated
   protein 6) and ATRX (alpha-thalassemia/mental retardation, X-linked) are
   associated with ALT in certain cancer types. The purpose of this study
   was to identify the most high-risk nsSNPs (non-synonymous Single
   Nucleotide Polymorphisms) within these three genes and assess their
   impacts on the structure and function of the proteins they encode.
   Methods: The reported genetic polymorphisms of SMARCAL1, DAXX and ATRX
   genes were retrieved from the Ensembl database. Later, various
   computational tools like PROVEAN, PolyPhen2, SNPs and GO, SNAP2,
   Predict-SNP, Panther and PMut were used to predict the most deleterious
   nsSNPs. MutPred was used to understand the underlying molecular reasons
   of those nsSNPs being deleterious, followed by prediction of Post
   Translational Modification Sites (PTMs) using ModPred. I-Mutant and
   MUpro were used to predict the effect of SNP on energy stability. Later,
   3D clustering analysis was done using Mutation 3D server. Moreover,
   ConSurf was utilized to identify the conservation scores of wild-type
   amino acids. Additionally, the NCBI conserved domain search tool was
   employed to pinpoint conserved domains within these three proteins.
   Project-Hope helped for biophysical validation, followed by prediction
   of these genes' interaction and function by using GeneMANIA. Result:
   Analysis on SMARCAL1 protein revealed that among 665 nsSNPs, four were
   identified as the most deleterious: L578S, T581S, P582A, and P582S.
   Similarly, within the DAXX protein, among a pool of 480 nsSNPs, P284S,
   R230C, and R230S were found out to be the most deleterious variants. In
   case of ATRX protein, V178D, R246C, and V277G, from the total of 1009
   nsSNPs, were predicted to be the most deleterious. All these nsSNPs were
   found to occur at residue positions that are 100 \% conserved within
   protein domains and were predicted to be most damaging from both
   structural and functional perspectives and highly destabilizing to their
   corresponding proteins. Conclusion: Computational investigation on the 3
   proteins-SMARCAL1, DAXX and ATRX through different bioinformatics
   analysis tools concludes that the identified high risk nsSNPs of these
   proteins are pathogenic SNPs. These variants potentially exert
   functional and structural influences, thus making them valuable
   candidates for future genetic studies.},

Abstract = {Tuftelin1 (TUFT1), an acidic protein constituent of developing and
   mineralizing tooth tissues, is regulated by hypoxia and the Hedgehog
   signaling pathway. We investigated the role of TUFT1 in hepatocellular
   carcinoma (HCC). qRT-PCR, immunohistochemistry and western blot were
   employed to evaluate TUFT1 level in HCC. MTT, BrdU, 3D culture and
   Transwell assays were used to assess cell viability, proliferation, in
   vitro growth, migration, and invasion. Subcutaneous and tail vein
   injection models were established to investigate in vivo growth and
   metastasis. Chromatin immunoprecipitation was performed to assess
   binding of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha) to TUFT1
   promoter. A microRNA array was used to identify hypoxia-related
   microRNAs. TUFT1 was elevated in HCC, and correlated with unfavorable
   clinicopathologic characteristics and poor survival. TUFT1 promoted HCC
   cell growth, metastasis and epithelial-mesenchymal transition in vitro
   and in vivo via activation of Ca2+/PI3K/AKT pathway. Hypoxia induced
   TUFT1 expression in an HIF-1 alpha dependent manner, and TUFT1
   expression was positively correlated with HIF-1a level in HCC tissues.
   Hypoxiaenhanced TUFT1 expression by downregulating miR-671-5p rather
   than by directly promoting the binding of HIF-1 alpha to TUFT1 promoter.
   MiR-671-5p interacted with the 3'-UTR of TUFT1 mRNA and subsequently
   inhibited TUFT1 expression. Consequently, knockdown of TUFT1 blocked the
   effects of hypoxia in promoting HCC progression. TUFT1 promoted the
   growth, metastasis and EMT of HCC cells through activating Ca2+/PI3K/AKT
   pathway. The hypoxic microenvironment increased the expression of TUFT1
   via downregulation of miR-671-5p. TUFT1 may function as a potential
   therapeutic target for the intervention and treatment of HCC.},

Abstract = {Background 6-Gingerol (6-G) is the primary active phytocomponent of
   ginger and has been shown to regulate multiple targets against cancer
   and its treatment. Androgen receptors (ARs) remain critical in the
   progression of prostate cancer (PCa). This study focuses on
   investigating 6-G as a promising anti-cancerous agent that inhibits AR
   activity significantly.Methods In this study, molecular docking
   simulation was done to investigate the binding affinity of 6-G and
   control drug Bicalutamide (BT) against oncogenic AR and tumor suppressor
   estrogen receptor beta (ER beta). The crystal structure of AR and ER
   beta was retrieved from Protein Data Bank (PDB) and docked with 3D
   Pubchem structures of 6-G using iGEMDOCK and AutoDock. Further in vitro
   study was done to evaluate the antioxidant, anti-cancerous, apoptotic,
   and wound healing potential of 6-G.Results The result displays that 6-G
   shows good binding affinity with AR and ER beta. Condensation of the
   nucleus, change in mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and the
   ability to induce reactive oxygen species (ROS) were done in human PCa
   PC-3 cells. Results from the MTT assay demonstrated that 6-G and control
   drug BT showed significant (p < 0.01) dose and time dependent inhibition
   of human PCa PC-3 cells. 6-G increased the ROS generation
   intracellularly and decreased the MMP, and cell migration in treated PCa
   PC-3 cells. 6-G treated cells showed fragmented, condensed chromatin and
   nuclear apoptotic bodies.Conclusions Thus, this study validates 6-G as a
   potential drug candidate against human PCa. However, further study of
   the anticancer potency of 6-G has to be done before its use for PCa
   treatment.},

Title = {Inhibition of histone demethylase KDM4 by ML324 induces apoptosis
   through the unfolded protein response and Bim upregulation in
   hepatocellular carcinoma cells},
Journal = {CHEMICO-BIOLOGICAL INTERACTIONS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {353},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is an extremely aggressive malignancy
   that ranks as the sixth-leading cause of cancer-associated death
   worldwide. Recently, various epigenetic mechanisms including gene
   methylation were reported to be potential next era HCC therapeutics and
   biomarkers. Although inhibition of epigenetic enzymes including histone
   lysine demethylase 4 (KDM4) enhanced cell death in HCC cells, the
   detailed mechanism of cell death machinery is poorly understood. In this
   study, we found that ML324, a small molecule KDM4-specific inhibitor,
   induced the death of HCC cells in a general cell culture system and 3D
   spheroid culture with increased cleavage of caspase-3. Mechanistically,
   we identified that unfolded protein responses (UPR) were involved in
   ML324-induced HCC cell death. Incubation of HCC cells with ML324
   upregulated death receptor 5 (DR5) expression through the activation
   transcription factor 3 (ATF3)-C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP)-dependent
   pathway. Moreover, we identified BIM protein as a mediator of
   ML324-induced apoptosis using CRISPR/Cas9 knockout analysis. We showed
   that the loss of Bim suppressed ML324-induced apoptosis by flow
   cytometry analysis, colony formation assay, and caspase-3 activation
   assay. Interestingly, BIM protein expression by ML324 was regulated by
   ATF3, CHOP, and DR5 which are factors involved in UPR. Specifically, we
   confirmed the regulating roles of KDM4E in Bim and CHOP expression using
   a chromatin immune precipitation (ChIP) assay. Physical binding of KDM4E
   to Bim and CHOP promoters decreased the response to ML324. Our findings
   suggest that KDM4 inhibition is a potent anti-tumor therapeutic strategy
   for human HCC, and further studies of UPR-induced apoptosis and the
   associated epigenetic functional mechanisms may lead to the discovery of
   novel target for future cancer therapy.},

Abstract = {Endoscopic bile duct brushing (EBDB) is carried out to differentiate
   benign from malignant biliary strictures in patients who have
   pancreaticobiliary disease. The sensitivity of this method for the
   diagnosis of malignancy is relatively low. The aim of this study is to
   analyze the cytomorphologic features that are helpful in increasing the
   sensitivity of detecting these lesions on cytologic samples. These
   features are compared with slides prepared with the ThinPrep(R)
   technique. The study included 142 patients with bile duct obstruction or
   pancreatic mass who underwent EBDB and follow-up surgery or biopsy
   between 1997 to 2000. Twenty-five (18\%) of these cases were positive
   for malignancy in both EBDB and follow-up surgical biopsy; 20 of these
   cases were used as positive controls (PC). Sixty-one (43\%) were
   negative in both EBDB and follow-up surgical biopsy specimens, and 21 of
   those cases were used as negative controls (NC). Fifty-six (39\%) cases
   were negative/atypical in EBDB cytology but were suspicious or positive
   in the surgical or biopsy specimens (false-negative). We identified the
   cytologic criteria that were helpful in differentiating our positive and
   negative control groups and applied these criteria to our false-negative
   group to see whether our sensitivity could be increased, using
   well-defined cytologic criteria alone. Of the 56 false-negative cases, 9
   (16\%) were upgraded to suspicious/positive based on the presence of the
   following features: three-dimensional (3D) micropapillae (95\% PC vs
   19\% NC, P < 0.0001), anisonucleosis (90\% PC vs 5\% NC, P < 0.0001),
   high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic (N/C) ratio (95\% PC vs 9\% NC, P < 0.0001),
   nuclear contour irregularity (65\% PC vs 24\% NC, P = 0.0079), and
   prominent nucleoli (70\% PC vs 38\% NC, P = 0.0406). Cytomorphologic
   features which were not helpful in distinguishing positive and negative
   cases were: single naked nuclei (50\% PC vs 28\% NC, P = 0.1597),
   chromatin granularity (50\% PC vs 62\% NC, P = 0.54), and necrosis (10\%
   PC vs 5\% NC, P = 0.5197). Improvement in diagnostic sensitivity, for
   carcinoma of pancreaticobiliary tract in EBDB samples may be achieved by
   identifying the key malignant cytomorphologic features: 3D
   micropapillae, anisonucleosis, nuclear contour irregularity, prominent
   nucleoli, and high N/C ratio. The sensitivity in detecting malignant
   biliary strictures increased from 31\% to 42\% based on these criteria
   in our current study. (C) 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Abstract = {The GINS complex, originally discovered in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and
   Xenopus laevis, binds to DNA replication origins shortly before the
   onset of S phase and travels with the replication forks after
   initiation. In this study we present a detailed characterization of the
   human GINS (hGINS) homolog. Using new antibodies that allow the
   detection of endogenous hGINS in cells and tissues, we have examined its
   expression, abundance, subcellular localization and association with
   other DNA replication proteins. Expression of hGINS is restricted to
   actively proliferating cells. During the S phase, hGINS becomes part of
   a Cdc45MCMGINS (CMG) complex that is assembled on chromatin.
   Down-regulation of hGINS destabilizes CMG, causes a G1S arrest and slows
   down ongoing DNA replication, effectively blocking cell proliferation.
   Our data support the notion that hGINS is an essential component of the
   human replisome.},

Abstract = {Cotton is an irreplaceable economic crop currently domesticated in the
   human world for its extremely elongated fiber cells specialized in seed
   epidermis, which makes it of high research and application value. To
   date, numerous research on cotton has navigated various aspects, from
   multi-genome assembly, genome editing, mechanism of fiber development,
   metabolite biosynthesis, and analysis to genetic breeding. Genomic and
   3D genomic studies reveal the origin of cotton species and the
   spatiotemporal asymmetric chromatin structure in fibers. Mature multiple
   genome editing systems, such as CRISPR/Cas9, Cas12 (Cpf1) and cytidine
   base editing (CBE), have been widely used in the study of candidate
   genes affecting fiber development. Based on this, the cotton fiber cell
   development network has been preliminarily drawn. Among them, the
   MYB-bHLH-WDR (MBW) transcription factor complex and IAA and BR signaling
   pathway regulate the initiation; various plant hormones, including
   ethylene, mediated regulatory network and membrane protein overlap
   fine-regulate elongation. Multistage transcription factors targeting
   CesA 4, 7, and 8 specifically dominate the whole process of secondary
   cell wall thickening. And fluorescently labeled cytoskeletal proteins
   can observe real-time dynamic changes in fiber development. Furthermore,
   research on the synthesis of cotton secondary metabolite gossypol,
   resistance to diseases and insect pests, plant architecture regulation,
   and seed oil utilization are all conducive to finding more high-quality
   breeding-related genes and subsequently facilitating the cultivation of
   better cotton varieties. This review summarizes the paramount research
   achievements in cotton molecular biology over the last few decades from
   the above aspects, thereby enabling us to conduct a status review on the
   current studies of cotton and provide strong theoretical support for the
   future direction.},

Abstract = {BackgroundUnderstanding the mechanism behind immune cell plasticity in
   cancer metastasis is crucial for identifying key regulators. Previously
   we found that mitotic factors regulate epithelial-mesenchymal
   transition, but how these factors convert to metastatic players in the
   tumor microenvironment (TME) is not fully understood.MethodsThe clinical
   importance of mitotic factors was analyzed by heatmap analysis, a KM
   plot, and immunohistochemistry in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) patients.
   Immunoprecipitation, LC-MS/MS, kinase assay, and site-directed
   mutagenesis were performed for the interaction and phosphorylation. A
   tail-vein injection mouse model, Transwell-based 3D culture, microarray
   analysis, coculture with monocytes, and chromatin immunoprecipitation
   assays were used to elucidate the function of phosphorylated FoxM1 in
   metastasis of TME.ResultsThe phosphorylated FoxM1 at Ser25 by PLK1
   acquires the reprogramming ability to stimulate the invasive traits in
   cancer and influence immune cell plasticity. This invasive form of
   p-FoxM1 upregulates the expression of IL1A/1B, VEGFA, and IL6 by direct
   activation, recruiting monocytes and promoting the polarization of
   M2d-like tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Upregulation of PD-L1 in
   LUAD having phosphomimetic FoxM1 facilitates immune evasion. In invasive
   LUAD with phosphomimetic FoxM1, IFITM1 is the most highly expressed
   through the activation of the STING-TBK1-IRF3 signaling, which enhances
   FoxM1-mediated signaling. Clinically, higher expression of FOXM1, PLK1,
   and IFITM1 is inversely correlated with the survival rate of advanced
   LUAD patients, providing a promising therapeutic strategy for the
   treatment of LUAD.ConclusionFoxM1-based therapy would be a potential
   therapeutic strategy for LUAD to reduce TAM polarization, immune escape,
   and metastasis, since FoxM1 functions as a genetic reprogramming factor
   reinforcing LUAD malignancy in the TME.},

Title = {Biotechnological approaches to the treatment of aspermatogenic men},
Journal = {CLINICS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {68},
Number = {1},
Pages = {157-167},
Abstract = {Aspermatogenesis is a severe impairment of spermatogenesis in which germ
   cells are completely lacking or present in an immature form, which
   results in sterility in approximately 25\% of patients. Because assisted
   reproduction techniques require mature germ cells, biotechnology is a
   valuable tool for rescuing fertility while maintaining biological
   fatherhood. However, this process involves, for instance, the
   differentiation of preexisting immature germ cells or the
   production/derivation of sperm from somatic cells. This review
   critically addresses four potential techniques: sperm derivation in
   vitro, germ stem cell transplantation, xenologous systems, and
   haploidization. Sperm derivation in vitro is already feasible in fish
   and mammals through organ culture or 3D systems, and it is very useful
   in conditions of germ cell arrest or in type II Sertoli-cell-only
   syndrome. Patients afflicted by type I Sertoli-cell-only syndrome could
   also benefit from gamete derivation from induced pluripotent stem cells
   of somatic origin, and human haploid-like cells have already been
   obtained by using this novel methodology. In the absence of alternative
   strategies to generate sperm in vitro, in germ cells transplantation
   fertility is restored by placing donor cells in the recipient
   germ-cell-free seminiferous epithelium, which has proven effective in
   conditions of spermatogonial arrest. Grafting also provides an approach
   for ex-vivo generation of mature sperm, particularly using prepubertal
   testis tissue. Although less feasible, haploidization is an option for
   creating gametes based on biological cloning technology. In conclusion,
   the aforementioned promising techniques remain largely experimental and
   still require extensive research, which should address, among other
   concerns, ethical and biosafety issues, such as gamete epigenetic
   status, ploidy, and chromatin integrity.},

Title = {SNAIL is induced by tamoxifen and leads to growth inhibition in invasive

Journal = {BREAST CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {175},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {PurposeInvasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) is a histological subtype of
   breast cancer that is predominantly estrogen receptor alpha
   (ER)-positive (+) and is thus treated with endocrine therapies. Herein,
   we sought to understand the molecular underpinnings of the
   4-hydroxytamoxifen (4OHT) resistance in ILC by assessing the potential
   role of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition transcription factor
   (EMT-TF) SNAIL (SNAI1).MethodsUsing a series of breast cancer cell
   lines, we measured the basal, estrogen and 4OHT-induced expression of
   SNAIL and other EMT-TF family members by quantitative reverse
   transcription-polymerase chain reaction and immunoblotting. Chromatin
   immunoprecipitation experiments were performed to assess ER binding to
   the SNAIL promoter. Cell proliferation, cell cycle and apoptosis were
   assessed in 2D cultures. 3D growth was assessed in Matrigel and Collagen
   I cultures.ResultsEstrogen and 4OHT induced SNAIL expression, but not
   that of the other EMT-TF family members SLUG (SNAI2) and SMUC (SNAI3),
   with the 4OHT effect being specific to the lobular but not the ductal
   subtype. We observed estrogen and 4OHT-induced ER recruitment to the
   SNAI1 promoter and high endogenous basal levels of SNAIL and several
   EMT-TFs in ILC cell lines. While SNAIL knockdown had a minor impact on
   the 4OHT partial agonism in estrogen-depleted conditions, it led to a
   surprising increase in cell proliferation in full serum. In
   complementary experiments, inducible SNAI1 overexpression caused
   decreased proliferation, associated with a cell cycle arrest in
   G(0)/G(1). Additionally, apoptosis was observed in BCK4
   cells.ConclusionThese data suggest a previously unrecognized role for
   SNAIL in ILC, substantiating a context-dependent behavior for this
   EMT-TF.},

Title = {Raw nuclear magnetic resonance data of human linker histone H1x, lacking

Abstract = {Linker histone H1 plays a vital role in the packaging of DNA. H1 has a
   tripartite structure: a conserved central globular domain that adopts a
   winged-helix fold, flanked by highly variable and intrinsically
   unstructured Nand C-terminal domains. The datasets presented in this
   article include raw 2D and 3D BEST-TROSY NMR data {[}1H-15 N HSQC; 15 N
   and 13C HNCO, HN(CO)CACB, HNCACB, HN(CA)CO] recorded for NGH1x, a
   truncated version of H1x containing the N-terminal and globular domains,
   but lacking the C-terminal domain. Experiments were conducted on
   double-labelled (15 N and 13C) NGH1x in `low' and `high salt,' to
   investigate the secondary structure content of the N-terminal domain of
   H1x under these conditions. We provide modelled structures of NGH1x (in
   low and high salt) based on the assigned chemical shifts in PDB format.
   The high salt structure of NGH1x (globular domain of H1x {[}GH1x; PDB:
   2LSO] with the H1x NTD) was docked to the nucleosome to generate
   NGH1xand GH1x-chromatosomes. The GH1x-chromatosome was generated for
   comparative purposes to elucidate the role of the N terminal domain. We
   present raw data trajectories of molecular dynamics simulations of these
   chromatosomes in this article. The MD dataset provides nanosecond
   resolution data on the dynamics of GH1xvs NGH1x-chromatosomes, which is
   useful to elucidate the DNA binding properties of the N terminal domain
   of H1x in chromatin, as well as the dynamic behaviour of linker DNA in
   these chromatosomes. (c) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Title = {Tetraploidy as a metastable state towards malignant cell transformation
   within a systemic approach of cancer development},
Journal = {MUTATION RESEARCH-GENETIC TOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL MUTAGENESIS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {896},

Abstract = {Tetraploidy, a condition in which a cell has four homologous sets of
   chromosomes, may be a natural physiological condition or
   pathophysiological such as in cancer cells or stress induced
   tetraploidisation. Its contribution to cancer development is well known.
   However, among the many models proposed to explain the causes,
   mechanisms and steps of malignant cell transformation, only few
   integrate tetraploidization into a systemic multistep approach of
   carcinogenesis. Therefore, we will i) describe the molecular and
   cellular characteristics of tetraploidy; ii) assess the contribution of
   stress-induced tetraploidy in cancer development; iii) situate
   tetraploidy as a metastable state leading to cancer development in a
   systemic cell-centered approach; iiii) consider knowledge gaps and
   future perspectives. The available data shows that stress-induced
   tetraploidisation/polyploidisation leads to p53 stabilisation, cell
   cycle arrest, followed by cellular senescence or apoptosis, suppressing
   the proliferation of tetraploid cells. However, if tetraploid cells
   escape the G1-tetraploidy checkpoint, it may lead to uncontrolled
   proliferation of tetraploid cells, micronuclei induction, aneuploidy and
   deploidisation. In addition, tetraploidization favors 3D-chromatin
   changes and epigenetic effects. The combined effects of genetic and
   epigenetic changes allow the expression of oncogenic gene expression and
   cancer progression. Moreover, since micronuclei are inducing
   inflammation, which in turn may induce additional tetraploidization,
   tetraploidyderived genetic instability leads to a carcinogenic vicious
   cycle. The concept that polyploid cells are metastable intermediates
   between diploidy and aneuploidy is not new. Metastability denotes an
   intermediate energetic state within a dynamic system other than the
   system's state at least energy. Considering in parallel the
   genetic/epigenetic changes and the probable entropy levels induced by
   stress-induced tetraploidisation provides a new systemic approach to
   describe cancer development.},

Title = {Regulation of Axon Guidance by Slit2 and Netrin-1 Signaling in the

Journal = {INVESTIGATIVE OPHTHALMOLOGY \& VISUAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {64},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {PURPOSE. Dry eye disease (DED) is multifactorial and associated with
   nerve abnormalities. We explored an Aquaporin 5
   (AQP5)-deficiency-induced JunB activation mechanism, which causes
   abnormal lacrimal gland (LG) nerve distribution through Slit2
   upregulation and Netrin-1 repression.METHODS. Aqp5 knockout (Aqp5-/-)
   and wild-type (Aqp5+/+) mice were studied. LGs were permeabilized and
   stained with neuronal class III beta-tubulin, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH),
   vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), and calcitonin gene-related peptide
   (CGRP). Whole-mount images were acquired through tissue clearing and 3D
   fluorescence imaging. Mouse primary trigeminal ganglion (TG) neurons
   were treated with LG extracts and Netrin-1/Slit2 neutralizing antibody.
   Transcription factor (TF) prediction and chromatin
   immunoprecipitation-polymerase chain reaction (ChIP-PCR) experiments
   verified the JunB binding and regulatory effect on Netrin-1 and
   Slit2.RESULTS. Three-dimensional tissue and section immunofluorescence
   showed reduced LG nerves in Aqp5-/- mice, with sympathetic and sensory
   nerves significantly decreased. Netrin-1 was reduced and Slit2 increased
   in Aqp5-/- mice LGs. Aqp5+/+ mice LG tissue extracts (TEs) promoted
   Aqp5-/- TG neurons axon growth, but Netrin-1 neutralizing antibody (NAb)
   could inhibit that promotion. Aqp5-/- mice LG TEs inhibited Aqp5+/+ TG
   axon growth, but Slit2 NAb alleviated that inhibition. Furthermore,
   JunB, a Netrin1 and Slit2 TF, could bind them and regulate their
   expression. SR11302, meanwhile, reversed the Netrin-1 and Slit2 shifts
   caused by AQP5 deficiency.CONCLUSIONS. AQP5 deficiency causes LG nerve
   abnormalities. Persistent JunB activation, the common denominator for
   Netrin-1 suppression and Slit2 induction, was found in Aqp5-/- mice LG
   epithelial cells. This affected sensory and sympathetic nerve fibers'
   distribution in LGs. Our findings provide insights into preventing,
   reversing, and treating DED.},

Title = {Benchmarking of next and third generation sequencing technologies and
   their associated algorithms for <i>de novo</i> genome assembly},
Journal = {MOLECULAR MEDICINE REPORTS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {23},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Genome assemblers are computational tools for de novo genome assembly,
   based on a plenitude of primary sequencing data. The quality of genome
   assemblies is estimated by their contiguity and the occurrences of
   misassemblies (duplications, deletions, translocations or inversions).
   The rapid development of sequencing technologies has enabled the rise of
   novel de novo genome assembly strategies. The ultimate goal of such
   strategies is to utilise the features of each sequencing platform in
   order to address the existing weaknesses of each sequencing type and
   compose a complete and correct genome map. In the present study, the
   hybrid strategy, which is based on Illumina short paired-end reads and
   Nanopore long reads, was benchmarked using MaSuRCA and Wengan
   assemblers. Moreover, the long-read assembly strategy, which is based on
   Nanopore reads, was benchmarked using Canu or PacBio HiFi reads were
   benchmarked using Hifiasm and HiCanu. The assemblies were performed on a
   computational cluster with limited computational resources. Their
   outputs were evaluated in terms of accuracy and computational
   performance. PacBio HiFi assembly strategy outperforms the other ones,
   while Hi-C scaffolding, which is based on chromatin 3D structure, is
   required in order to increase continuity, accuracy and completeness when
   large and complex genomes, such as the human one, are assembled. The use
   of Hi-C data is also necessary while using the hybrid assembly strategy.
   The results revealed that HiFi sequencing enabled the rise of novel
   algorithms which require less genome coverage than that of the other
   strategies making the assembly a less computationally demanding task.
   Taken together, these developments may lead to the democratisation of
   genome assembly projects which are now approachable by smaller labs with
   limited technical and financial resources.},

   Carcinoma},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN BIOENGINEERING AND BIOTECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Month = {JUN 30},
Abstract = {Enhancers can act as cis-regulatory elements to control transcriptional
   regulation by recruiting transcription factors (TFs) in a distance and
   orientation-independent manner. However, it is still unclear how p53
   participates in the enhancer network as TF in hepatic carcinoma under
   the condition of DNA damage. A total of 14,286 active enhancers were
   identified through the integration of stable and unstable enhancer RNAs
   (eRNAs) captured by CAGE and GRO-seq, respectively. Furthermore, 218
   p53-bound enhancers (Enhp53) were identified by analyzing p53 ChIP-seq
   in HepG2 cells after DNA damage. The results showed that the enhancer
   expression and histone markers of enhancers (H3K4me1, H3K4me2, H3K4me3,
   H3K9ac, and H3K27ac) revealed significantly higher level on Enh(p53)
   than Enh(no-p53) which suggested that p53 participated in regulating
   enhancer activity and chromatin structure. By analyzing 124 TFs ChIP-seq
   from ENCODE, 93 TFs were found significantly enriched on Enhp53 such as
   GATA4, YY1, and CTCF, indicating p53 may co-regulate enhancers with TFs
   participation. Moreover, significantly differentially expressed 438
   miRNAs and 1,264 mRNAs were identified by analyzing small RNA-seq and
   RNA-seq, and 26 Enh(p53)-miRNAs and 145 Enh(p53)-mRNA interactions were
   identified by the integration of 3D genome data and genomic distance.
   The functional enrichment analysis showed that these miRNA targets and
   mRNAs were significantly involved in tumor biological processes and
   signaling pathways such as DNA replication, p53 signaling pathway,
   hepatitis B, focal adhesion, etc. The above results indicated that p53
   participated in regulating enhancer network in hepatic carcinoma and
   Enh(p53) exhibited significantly different characteristics with
   Enh(no-p53).},

Title = {qc3C: Reference-free quality control for Hi-C sequencing data},
Journal = {PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {17},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Hi-C is a sample preparation method that enables high-throughput
   sequencing to capture genome-wide spatial interactions between DNA
   molecules. The technique has been successfully applied to solve
   challenging problems such as 3D structural analysis of chromatin,
   scaffolding of large genome assemblies and more recently the accurate
   resolution of metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs). Despite continued
   refinements, however, preparing a Hi-C library remains a complex
   laboratory protocol. To avoid costly failures and maximise the odds of
   successful outcomes, diligent quality management is recommended. Current
   wet-lab methods provide only a crude assay of Hi-C library quality,
   while key post-sequencing quality indicators used have-thus far-relied
   upon reference-based read-mapping. When a reference is accessible, this
   reliance introduces a concern for quality, where an incomplete or
   inexact reference skews the resulting quality indicators. We propose a
   new, reference-free approach that infers the total fraction of
   read-pairs that are a product of proximity ligation. This quantification
   of Hi-C library quality requires only a modest amount of sequencing data
   and is independent of other application-specific criteria. The algorithm
   builds upon the observation that proximity ligation events are likely to
   create k-mers that would not naturally occur in the sample. Our software
   tool (qc3C) is to our knowledge the first to implement a reference-free
   Hi-C QC tool, and also provides reference-based QC, enabling Hi-C to be
   more easily applied to non-model organisms and environmental samples. We
   characterise the accuracy of the new algorithm on simulated and real
   datasets and compare it to reference-based methods.},

Abstract = {Aberrant gene expression underlies drug addiction. Therefore, studying
   the regulation of gene expression in drug addiction may provide
   mechanistic insights into this disease, for which there are still only
   limited treatments. Recently, the three-dimensional (3D) organization of
   linear DNA in the nucleus has been recognized as having a major
   influence on gene transcription. Here, we review its roles in both basic
   brain function and neuropsychiatric disorders, while also highlighting
   its emerging implications in drug addiction. Unraveling the 3D
   architecture of chromosomes in drug addiction is adding to our
   understanding of this disease and has the potential to trigger novel
   approaches for better diagnosis and therapy.},

Abstract = {Liposarcoma (LPS) is the most common soft-tissue sarcoma in adults with
   two major subtypes, well differentiated and dediffer-entiated. Both
   subtypes are characterized with the pathognomonic giant ring or marker
   chromosomes that harbor high copy numbers of known oncogenes. Here, we
   reported a comprehensive molecular characterization of both tumor and
   normal tissues from the same patients with LPS, including whole-genome
   sequencing (WGS), transcriptome, enhancer landscape, and genome-wide
   three-dimensional (3D) genome structure by Hi-C. Tumor-specific
   tran-scripts and regulatory elements were identified, and enhancer
   coamplification and hijacking events were discovered as novel mechanisms
   upregulating oncogenes such as MDM2, CDK4, and HMGA2. Combining Hi-C,
   optical mapping, nanopore long reads, and WGS data partially resolved
   complex structural variations and reconstructed the local genome and the
   giant chromosome. Overall, this study provides a comprehensive resource
   for LPS research and offers insights into how altered enhancers and the
   3D genome contribute to gene dysregulation in cancer.Significance:
   Comprehensive profiling of the enhancer land-scape and 3D genome
   structure in liposarcoma identifies exten-sive enhancer-oncogene
   coamplification and enhancer hijacking events, deepening the
   understanding of how oncogenes are regulated in cancer.},

Title = {Three-dimensional positioning and structure of chromosomes in a human
   prophase nucleus},
Journal = {SCIENCE ADVANCES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {3},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The human genetic material is packaged into 46 chromosomes. The
   structure of chromosomes is known at the lowest level, where the DNA
   chain is wrapped around a core of eight histone proteins to form
   nucleosomes. Around a million of these nucleosomes, each about 11 nm in
   diameter and 6 nm in thickness, are wrapped up into the complex
   organelle of the chromosome, whose structure is mostly known at the
   level of visible light microscopy to form a characteristic cross shape
   in metaphase. However, the higher-order structure of human chromosomes,
   between a few tens and hundreds of nanometers, has not been well
   understood. We show a three-dimensional (3D) image of a human prophase
   nucleus obtained by serial block-face scanning electron microscopy, with
   36 of the complete set of 46 chromosomes captured within it. The
   acquired image allows us to extract quantitative 3D structural
   information about the nucleus and the preserved, intact individual
   chromosomes within it, including their positioning and full spatial
   morphology at a resolution of around 50 nm in three dimensions. The
   chromosome positions were found, at least partially, to follow the
   pattern of chromosome territories previously observed only in
   interphase. The 3D conformation shows parallel, planar alignment of the
   chromatids, whose occupied volumes are almost fully accounted for by the
   DNA and known chromosomal proteins. We also propose a potential new
   method of identifying human chromosomes in three dimensions, on the
   basis of the measurements of their 3D morphology.},

Title = {Var divide Decrypt: a novel and user-friendly tool to explore and
   prioritize variants in whole-exome sequencing data},
Journal = {EPIGENETICS \& CHROMATIN},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {16},
Number = {1},
Month = {JUN 14},
Abstract = {Background High-throughput sequencing (HTS) offers unprecedented
   opportunities for the discovery of causative gene variants in multiple
   human disorders including cancers, and has revolutionized clinical
   diagnostics. However, despite more than a decade of use of HTS-based
   assays, extracting relevant functional information from whole-exome
   sequencing (WES) data remains challenging, especially for
   non-specialists lacking in-depth bioinformatic skills.
   Results To address this limitation, we developed Var vertical bar
   Decrypt, a web-based tool designed to greatly facilitate WES data
   browsing and analysis. Var vertical bar Decrypt offers a wide range of
   gene and variant filtering possibilities, clustering and enrichment
   tools, providing an efficient way to derive patient-specific functional
   information and to prioritize gene variants for functional analyses. We
   applied Var vertical bar Decrypt on WES datasets of 10 acute erythroid
   leukemia patients, a rare and aggressive form of leukemia, and recovered
   known disease oncogenes in addition to novel putative drivers. We
   additionally validated the performance of Var vertical bar Decrypt using
   an independent dataset of similar to 90 multiple myeloma WES,
   recapitulating the identified deregulated genes and pathways, showing
   the general applicability and versatility of Var vertical bar Decrypt
   for WES analysis.
   Conclusion Despite years of use of WES in human health for diagnosis and
   discovery of disease drivers, WES data analysis still remains a complex
   task requiring advanced bioinformatic skills. In that context, there is
   a need for user-friendly all-in-one dedicated tools for data analysis,
   to allow biologists and clinicians to extract relevant biological
   information from patient datasets. Here, we provide Var vertical bar
   Decrypt (trial version accessible here:
   https://vardecrypt.com/app/vardecrypt), a simple and intuitive Rshiny
   application created to fill this gap. Source code and detailed user
   tutorial are available at https://gitlab.com/mohammadsalma/vardecrypt.},

Abstract = {Elevated overexpression of the lncRNA HOTAIR mediates invasion and
   metastasis in breast cancer. In an apparent paradox, we observed low
   expression of HOTAIR in the invasive Claudin-low MDA-MB-231 and Hs578T
   cells in two-dimensional culture (2D). However, HOTAIR expression
   exhibited robust induction in laminin-rich extracellular matrix-based
   three-dimensional organotypic culture (lrECM 3D) over that in 2D
   culture. Induction of HOTAIR required intact ECM signaling, namely
   integrin 2 and SRC kinase activity. Moreover, invasive growth was
   suppressed by HOTAIR-specific siRNA. Induction of HOTAIR in lrECM 3D
   culture resulted from the activation of a novel isoform of HOTAIR
   (HOTAIR-N) whose transcription is started from the first intron of the
   HOXC11 gene. The HOTAIR-N promoter exhibited increased trimethylation of
   histone H3 lysine 4, a histone marker of active transcription, and
   binding of BRD4, a reader of transcriptionally active histone markers.
   Inhibition of BRD4 substantially reduced the expression of HOTAIR in
   lrECM 3D culture. In summary, our results indicate that HOTAIR
   expression is activated by BRD4 binding to a novel HOTAIR-N promoter in
   Claudin-low breast cancer cells that are attached to ECM. Induction of
   HOTAIR is required for invasive growth of Claudin-low breast cancer
   cells in lrECM 3D culture.},

Abstract = {Cohesin, a member of the SMC complex family, holds sister chromatids
   together but also shapes chromosomes by promoting the formation of
   long-range intra-chromatid loops, a process proposed to be mediated by
   DNA loop extrusion. Here we describe the roles of three cohesin
   partners, Pds5, Wpl1, and Eco1, in loop formation along either
   unre-plicated or mitotic Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosomes. Pds5
   limits the size of DNA loops via two different pathways: the canonical
   Wpl1-mediated releasing activity and an Eco1-dependent mechanism. In the
   absence of Pds5, the main barrier to DNA loop expansion appears to be
   the centromere. Our data also show that Ecol acetyl-transferase inhibits
   the translocase activity that powers loop formation and contributes to
   the positioning of loops through a mechanism that is distinguishable
   from its role in cohesion establishment. This study reveals that the
   mechanisms regulating cohesin-dependent chromatin loops are conserved
   among eukaryotes while promoting different functions.},

Title = {A chromosomal connectome for psychiatric and metabolic risk variants in
   adult dopaminergic neurons},
Journal = {GENOME MEDICINE},

Abstract = {Background Midbrain dopaminergic neurons (MDN) represent 0.0005\% of the
   brain's neuronal population and mediate cognition, food intake, and
   metabolism. MDN are also posited to underlay the neurobiological
   dysfunction of schizophrenia (SCZ), a severe neuropsychiatric disorder
   that is characterized by psychosis as well as multifactorial medical
   co-morbidities, including metabolic disease, contributing to markedly
   increased morbidity and mortality. Paradoxically, however, the genetic
   risk sequences of psychosis and traits associated with metabolic
   disease, such as body mass, show very limited overlap. Methods We
   investigated the genomic interaction of SCZ with medical conditions and
   traits, including body mass index (BMI), by exploring the MDN's
   ``spatial genome,{''} including chromosomal contact landscapes as a
   critical layer of cell type-specific epigenomic regulation. Low-input
   Hi-C protocols were applied to 5-10 x 10(3) dopaminergic and other
   cell-specific nuclei collected by fluorescence-activated nuclei sorting
   from the adult human midbrain. Results The Hi-C-reconstructed MDN
   spatial genome revealed 11 ``Euclidean hot spots{''} of clustered
   chromatin domains harboring risk sequences for SCZ and elevated BMI.
   Inter- and intra-chromosomal contacts interconnecting SCZ and BMI risk
   sequences showed massive enrichment for brain-specific expression
   quantitative trait loci (eQTL), with gene ontologies, regulatory motifs
   and proteomic interactions related to adipogenesis and lipid regulation,
   dopaminergic neurogenesis and neuronal connectivity, and reward- and
   addiction-related pathways. Conclusions We uncovered shared nuclear
   topographies of cognitive and metabolic risk variants. More broadly, our
   PsychENCODE sponsored Hi-C study offers a novel genomic approach for the
   study of psychiatric and medical co-morbidities constrained by limited
   overlap of their respective genetic risk architectures on the linear
   genome.},

Abstract = {Adherent eukaryotic cells are subjected to a broad variety of
   extracellular and intracellular stimuli regulating their behaviour.
   These stimuli can be either purely chemical, for example soluble factors
   binding to the cell membrane, or mechano-chemical, for example
   integrin-based adhesion complexes stretching the cell cytoskeleton.
   Here, we focus on mechano-chemical stimuli such as extracellular forces
   (interstitial flow, pressurization) and intracellular forces (due to
   cell adhesion), which may combine generating stress-strain states in the
   cytoskeleton. These states are transferred to the nucleus to influence
   the transcription of specific genes, likely by changing the chromatin
   organization and by altering the permeability of the nuclear membrane.
   While there exists increasing experimental evidence of the
   mechanosensing role of the cell nucleus, both the underlying molecular
   mechanisms involved, and the nuclear structural behaviour in response to
   forces, are still poorly understood. Here, we review the existing
   literature on computational models developed to investigate the
   chemo-mechanical behaviour of adherent eukaryotic cells. We analyse two
   main classes of models of single-cell mechanics, based either on the
   discrete or on the continuum approaches. We focus on the
   bio-chemo-mechanical model and modelling techniques accounting for the
   nuclear body. The modelling techniques are discussed highlighting their
   ability in predicting cytoskeletal contractility states and nuclear
   stress-strain states.},

Abstract = {Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) coupled with confocal
   microscopy has been used to reveal the interphase chromosome
   organization in plants. In wheat and several other related species, we
   have shown that the interphase chromosomes are in a very well-defined
   organization, with centromeres and telomeres located at opposite sides
   of the nuclear envelope-a classic Rabl configuration. In transgenic
   wheat lines, FISH analysis of metaphase chromosomes has shown that
   multiple transgene copies can be integrated along a single chromosome,
   with large regions of intervening genomic sequence. These multiple
   copies are often colocalized in interphase, suggesting either an ectopic
   association or a highly reproducible interphase chromatin configuration.
   Bromouridine (BrU) incorporation has been used to label transcription
   sites in the nucleolus. Using pea root tissue, we have combined BrU
   incorporation with preembedding 1-nm gold detection to image the
   nucleolar transcription sites by electron microscopy. This has revealed
   many distinct elongated clusters of silver-gold particles. These
   clusters are 200-300 nm in length and are thicker at one end than the
   other. We suggest that each cluster corresponds to a single transcribed
   gene. Serial sectioning of several entire nucleoli has enabled the
   reconstruction of all the nucleolar transcription sites, and we have
   estimated that there are 200-300 transcribed genes per nucleolus. (C)

Abstract = {In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Mrc1 (homolog of human Claspin and mediator
   of replication checkpoint) is not only a part of the replication
   machine, but also participates in the replication stress response when
   DNA replication is blocked by hydroxyurea. Since Mrc1 is expressed in a
   small amount in cells and has many proteins interacting with it as a
   mediator, it is difficult to obtain Mrc1 with high concentration and
   purity. This article reports the purification of a stable truncation of
   Mrc1 and the full length Mrc1. High concentration and high purity of
   Mrc1 was obtained and the three-dimensional structure of Mrc1 was
   analyzed, which is a ring with a hole in the center. At the same time,
   we found that Mrc1 has an interaction with Rad24-RFC a clamp loader in
   the replication checkpoint, and can form a complex with it, implying
   that we can assemble large replication checkpoint complexes in vitro.
   These results initially reveal the ring structure of Mrc1 and its
   interaction with Rad24-RFC in replication checkpoints in S. cerevisiae.},

Title = {Spatially modulated illumination microscopy using one objective lens},
Journal = {OPTICAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {46},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The spatially modulated illumination (SMI) microscope is a wide-field
   fluorescence microscope featuring axially structured illumination,
   through which access to information about subresolution object
   structures is obtained. We present a simplified setup where the
   interference pattern is generated by reflecting the laser beam with a
   mirror. We characterize our setup by presenting measurements on
   fluorescent microspheres with diameters ranging from 44 to 200 nm. The
   results agree well with the sizes provided by the manufacturer.
   Furthermore, the spheres are analyzed with 458-, 514-, 488-, and 568-nm
   excitation wavelengths, giving good agreement of the sizes determined at
   the respective wavelengths. A measurement of the same objects using
   different excitation wavelengths leads to a size difference of a few
   nanometers only. The potential of SMI microscopy for the fast analysis
   of many fluorescent objects is also addressed. In addition, the
   applicability to biological specimens is shown on fluorescently labeled,
   specific chromatin domains. The results obtained using the presented
   mirror geometry agree well with data obtained using a standard SMI
   microscope setup. (c) 2007 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation

Abstract = {Hi-C experiments capturing the 3D genome architecture have led to the
   discovery of topologically-associated domains (TADs) that form an
   important part of the 3D genome organization and appear to play a role
   in gene regulation and other functions. Several histone modifications
   have been independently suggested as the possible explanations of TAD
   formation, but their combinatorial effects on domain formation remain
   poorly understood at a global scale. Here, we propose a convex
   semi-nonparametric approach called nTDP based on Bernstein polynomials
   to explore the joint effects of histone markers on TAD formation as well
   as predict TADs solely from the histone data. We find a small subset of
   modifications to be predictive of TADs across species. By inferring TADs
   using our trained model, we are able to predict TADs across different
   species and cell types, without the use of Hi-C data, suggesting their
   effect is conserved. This work provides the first comprehensive joint
   model of the effect histone markers on domain formation.},

Abstract = {H3K9me3-dependent heterochromatin is critical for the silencing of
   repeat-rich pericentromeric regions and also has key roles in repressing
   lineage-inappropriate protein-coding genes in differentiation and
   development. Here, we investigate the molecular consequences of
   heterochromatin loss in cells deficient in both SUV39H1 and SUV39H2
   (Suv39DKO), the major mammalian histone methyltransferase enzymes that
   catalyze heterochromatic H3K9me3 deposition. We reveal a paradoxical
   repression of protein-coding genes in Suv39DKO cells, with these
   differentially expressed genes principally in euchromatic
   (Tn5-accessible, H3K4me3- and H3K27ac-marked) rather than
   heterochromatic (H3K9me3-marked) or polycomb (H3K27me3-marked) regions.
   Examination of the three-dimensional (3D) nucleome reveals that
   transcriptomic dysregulation occurs in euchromatic regions close to the
   nuclear periphery in 3D space. Moreover, this transcriptomic
   dysregulation is highly correlated with altered 3D genome organization
   in Suv39DKO cells. Together, our results suggest that the nuclear
   lamina-tethering of Suv39-dependent H3K9me3 domains provides an
   essential scaffold to support euchromatic genome organization and the
   maintenance of gene transcription for healthy cellular function.},

Title = {Epigenomic signatures associated with spontaneous and replication
   stress-induced DNA double strand breaks},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN GENETICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Month = {NOV 24},
Abstract = {Common fragile sites (CFSs) are specific regions of all individuals'
   genome that are predisposed to DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) and
   undergo subsequent rearrangements. CFS formation can be induced in vitro
   by mild level of DNA replication stress, such as DNA polymerase
   inhibition or nucleotide pool disturbance. The mechanisms of CFS
   formation have been linked to DNA replication timing control,
   transcription activities, as well as chromatin organization. However, it
   is unclear what specific cis- or trans-factors regulate the interplay
   between replication and transcription that determine CFS formation. We
   recently reported genome-wide mapping of DNA DSBs under replication
   stress induced by aphidicolin in human lymphoblastoids for the first
   time. Here, we systematically compared these DSBs with regards to nearby
   epigenomic features mapped in the same cell line from published studies.
   We demonstrate that aphidicolin-induced DSBs are strongly correlated
   with histone 3 lysine 36 trimethylation, a marker for active
   transcription. We further demonstrate that this DSB signature is a
   composite effect by the dual treatment of aphidicolin and its solvent,
   dimethylsulfoxide, the latter of which potently induces transcription on
   its own. We also present complementing evidence for the association
   between DSBs and 3D chromosome architectural domains with high density
   gene cluster and active transcription. Additionally, we show that while
   DSBs were detected at all but one of the fourteen finely mapped CFSs,
   they were not enriched in the CFS core sequences and rather demarcated
   the CFS core region. Related to this point, DSB density was not higher
   in large genes of greater than 300 kb, contrary to reported enrichment
   of CFS sites at these large genes. Finally, replication timing analyses
   demonstrate that the CFS core region contain initiation events,
   suggesting that altered replication dynamics are responsible for CFS
   formation in relatively higher level of replication stress.},

Title = {Molecular characterization and expression profile of estrogen receptor
   subtypes in female hilsa (<i>Tenualosa ilisha</i>)},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {11},
Month = {JUN 5},
Abstract = {Hilsa (Tenualosa ilisha), a highly prized edible fish, is consumed by
   over 250 million people worldwide. Estrogens are essential hormones
   required during reproduction and bind with estrogen receptors in target
   organs for biological activity. The two unique subtypes of the estrogen
   receptor found in fish are alpha (alpha) and beta (beta) and exhibit
   distinctive roles in reproduction. The present study aimed to understand
   the breeding physiology of hilsa during the seasonal gonadal cycles
   through GSI seasonal variation, histological study, and molecular
   identification, characterization, and transcriptional modification of
   estrogen receptors in hilsa. Monthly GSI analysis from females showed
   that during September, the GSI value was maximum (22.01 +/- 0.68),
   followed by the May GSI value (18.78 +/- 0.97). Histological observation
   showed the formation of asynchronous gametes during the development of
   ovaries. The histological analysis revealed the formation of developing
   oocytes, nucleus, presence of primary oogonia, secondary oogonia,
   chromatin nucleolar oocytes, and early perinucleolar oocytes in the
   ovary (January-early July). Progressively, formations of the yolk
   vesicles, yolk granule stage, premature stage, and mature stage with
   post-ovulatory follicles were also identified. Linear observation was
   recorded during the monsoon season from July to November. Furthermore,
   partial length cDNAs for estrogen receptors were characterized, and
   their mRNA expression patterns demonstrate that ER-alpha expression
   significantly increased in September, followed by April and August in
   the ovary and liver tissue. Both the liver and ovary showed the highest
   mRNA expression of ER-beta in September. The study revealed that
   ER-alpha expression was higher in the ovary as compared with liver
   tissue. Furthermore, we introduce three-dimensional (3D) models
   depicting the hilsa estrogen receptors in complex with estradiol (E2),
   constructed through homology modeling. This investigation contributes
   valuable insights into the molecular characteristics of estrogen
   receptors in this teleost fish. Our present work provided preliminary
   evidence of estrogen receptors during reproduction in hilsa.},

Title = {Physical mapping of wheat-<i>Aegilops longissima</i> breakpoints in
   mildew-resistant recombinant lines using FISH with highly repeated and
   low-copy DNA probes},

Abstract = {Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with multiple probes,
   consisting of highly repeated DNA sequences (pSc119.2 and pAs1) and of a
   low-copy, 3BS-specific RFLP sequence (PSR907), enabled determination of
   the physical position of the wheat-alien breakpoints (BPs) along the 3BS
   and 3DS arms of common wheat recombinant lines. These lines harbour
   3S(1)S Aegilops longissima segments containing the powdery mildew
   resistance gene Pm13. In all 3B recombinants, the wheat-Aegilops
   longissima physical BPs lie within the interval separating the two most
   distal of the three pSc119.2 3BS sites. In all such recombinants a
   telomeric segment, containing the most distal of the pSc119.2 3BS sites,
   was in fact replaced by a homoeologous Ae. longissima segment, marked by
   characteristic pSc119.2 hybridization sites. Employment of the PSR907
   RFLP probe as a FISH marker allowed to resolve further the critical
   region in the various 3B recombinant lines. Three of them, like the
   control common wheat, exhibited between the two most distal pSc119.2
   sites a single PSR907 FISH site, which was missing in a fourth
   recombinant line. The amount of alien chromatin can thus be estimated to
   represent around 20\% of the recombinant arm in the three former lines
   and a maximum of 27\% in the latter. A similar physical length was
   calculated for the alien segment contained in three 3D recombinants, all
   characterized by the presence of the Ae. longissima pSc119.2 sites
   distal to the nearly telomeric pAs1 sites of normal 3DS. Comparison
   between the FISH-based maps and previously developed RFLP maps of the
   3BS-3S(1)S and 3DS-3S(1)S arms revealed substantial differences between
   physical and genetic map positions of the wheat-alien BPs and of
   molecular markers associated with the critical chromosomal portions.},

   was found 3 days prior to death followed by lymphocytopenia, initially
   of normal cells but eventually of all lymphocytes 1 day before death.
   The lymphocytosis of infectious mononucleosis (1 case) was found to be
   entirely due to an increase in Type II lymphocytes. The lymphocytic
   indices (ratio of Type II cells to normal lymphocytes) of a group of
   normal subjects averaged 0.36 {[}plus or minus]0.05 while 3 groups of

Abstract = {Developments in proximity ligation methods and sequencing technologies
   have provided high-resolution views of the organization of the genome
   inside the nucleus. A prominent feature of Hi-C maps is regions of
   increased self-interaction called topologically associating domains
   (TADs). Despite the strong evolutionary conservation and clear link with
   gene expression, the exact role of TADs and even their definition
   remains debatable. Here, I review the discovery of TADs, how they are
   commonly identified, and the mechanisms that lead to their formation.
   Furthermore, I discuss recent results that have created a more nuanced
   view of the role of TADs in the regulation of genes. In light of this, I
   propose that when we define TADs, we also consider the mechanisms that
   shape them. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {The c-Myc/TBX3 Axis Promotes Cellular Transformation of
   Sarcoma-Initiating Cells},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {11},
Month = {JAN 25},
Abstract = {Sarcomas are highly aggressive cancers of mesenchymal origin whose
   clinical management is highly complex. This is partly due to a lack of
   understanding of the molecular mechanisms underpinning the
   transformation of mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (MSCs) which are
   presumed to be the sarcoma-initiating cells. c-Myc is
   amplified/overexpressed in a range of sarcomas where it has an
   established oncogenic role and there is evidence that it contributes to
   the malignant transformation of MSCs. T-box transcription factor 3
   (TBX3) is upregulated by c-Myc in a host of sarcoma subtypes where it
   promotes proliferation, tumor formation, migration, and invasion. This
   study investigated whether TBX3 is a c-Myc target in human MSCs (hMSCs)
   and whether overexpressing TBX3 in hMSCs can phenocopy c-Myc
   overexpression to promote malignant transformation. Using siRNA,
   qRT-PCR, luciferase reporter and chromatin-immunoprecipitation assays,
   we show that c-Myc binds and directly activates TBX3 transcription in
   hMSCs at a conserved E-box motif. When hMSCs were engineered to stably
   overexpress TBX3 using lentiviral gene transfer and the resulting cells
   characterised in 2D and 3D, the overexpression of TBX3 was shown to
   promote self-renewal, bypass senescence, and enhance proliferation which
   corresponded with increased levels of cell cycle progression markers
   (cyclin A, cyclin B1, CDK2) and downregulation of the p14(ARF)/MDM2/p53
   tumor suppressor pathway. Furthermore, TBX3 promoted the migratory and
   invasive ability of hMSCs which associated with increased levels of
   markers of migration (Vimentin, SLUG, SNAIL, TWIST1) and invasion (MMP2,
   MMP9). Transcriptomic analysis revealed that genes upregulated upon TBX3
   overexpression overlapped with c-myc targets, were involved in cell
   cycle progression, and were associated with sarcomagenesis. Together,
   the data described indicate that the c-Myc/TBX3 oncogenic molecular
   pathway may be a key mechanism that transforms hMSCs into sarcomas.},

Abstract = {Therapeutic application of microRNAs (miRNAs) in Wnt-driven glioma has
   been valuable; however, their specific roles and mechanisms have not
   been completely investigated. Real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) was
   used to analyse the expression of microRNA-129-5p (miR-129-5p) in human
   glioma samples. Cell-Counting Kit 8 (CCK-8), flow cytometry, EdU,
   angiogenesis, Transwell invasion, wound healing, in vitro 3D migration
   and neurosphere formation assays were employed to assess the role of
   miR-129-5p in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) cells. Moreover, we
   performed the luciferase reporter assay and the RNA-ChIP (chromatin
   immunoprecipitation) assay to confirm whether Wnt5a was a direct target
   of miR-129-5p. We also confirmed the correlation between the expression
   profile of miR-129-5p and Wnt5a in glioma patients from the Chinese
   Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA) and investigated the overall survival of GBM
   patients using two data sets, namely, TCGA and GSE16011, according to
   their Wnt5a expression status. MiR-129-5p expression levels were
   downregulated and inversely correlated with Wnt5a expression levels in
   CGGA glioma patients. Restored expression of miR-129-5p blocked GBM cell
   proliferation, invasion, migration, angiogenesis, neurosphere formation
   and resistance to temozolomide. We reported that miR-129-5p directly
   targeted Wnt5a in glioma. Furthermore, we observed that overexpression
   of miR-129-5p inhibited the expression of Wnt5a, thus blocking the
   protein kinase C(PKC)/ERK/NF-kappa B and JNK pathways. Inhibiting Wnt5a
   rescued the effects of miR-129-5p loss and increased Wnt5a expression
   was associated with reduced overall survival of GBM patients. We also
   demonstrated the inhibitory effect of miR-129-5p on tumour growth in GBM
   using an in vivo model. The miR-129-5p/Wnt5a-axis-mediated
   PKC/ERK/NF-kappa B and JNK pathways have therapeutic potential in GBM

Title = {Confocal fluorescence assessment of bioenergy/redox status of dromedary

Year = {2014},

Abstract = {Background: Reproductive biotechnologies in dromedary camel (Camelus
   dromedarius) are less developed than in other livestock species. The in
   vitro maturation (IVM) technology is a fundamental step for in vitro
   embryo production (IVP), and its optimization could represent a way to
   increase the success rate of IVP. The aim of the present study was to
   investigate the bioenergy/oxidative status of dromedary camel oocytes
   before and after IVM by confocal microscopy 3D imaging.
   Methods: Oocytes were retrieved by slicing ovaries collected at local
   slaughterhouses. Recovered oocytes were examined before and after IVM
   culture for nuclear chromatin configuration and bioenergy/oxidative
   status, expressed as mitochondria (mt) distribution and activity,
   intracellular Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) levels and distribution and
   mt/ROS colocalization.
   Results: The mean recovery rate was 6 oocytes/ovary. After IVM, 61\% of
   oocytes resumed meiosis and 36\% reached the Metaphase II stage (MII).
   Oocyte bioenergy/redox confocal characterization revealed changes upon
   meiosis progression. Immature oocytes at the germinal vesicle (GV) stage
   were characterised by prevailing homogeneous mt distribution in small
   aggregates while MI and MII oocytes showed significantly higher rates of
   pericortical mt distribution organized in tubular networks (P < 0.05).
   Increased mt activity in MI (P < 0.001) and MII (P < 0.01) oocytes
   compared to GV stage oocytes was also observed. At any meiotic stage,
   homogeneous distribution of intracellular ROS was observed.
   Intracellular ROS levels also increased in MI (P < 0.01) and MII (P <
   0.05) oocytes compared to GV stage oocytes. The mt/ROS colocalization
   signal increased in MI oocytes (P < 0.05).
   Conclusions: This study provides indications that qualitative and
   quantitative indicators of bioenergy and oxidative status in dromedary
   camel oocytes are modified in relation with oocyte meiotic stage. These
   data may increase the knowledge of camel oocyte physiology, in order to
   enhance the efficiency of IVP procedures.},

Title = {Characterization of the interactions between Codanin-1 and C15Orf41, two
   proteins implicated in congenital dyserythropoietic anemia type I
   disease},
Journal = {BMC MOLECULAR AND CELL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {21},

Month = {MAR 23},
Abstract = {Background Congenital dyserythropoietic anemia type I (CDA I), is an
   autosomal recessive disease with macrocytic anemia in which erythroid
   precursors in the bone marrow exhibit pathognomonic abnormalities
   including spongy heterochromatin and chromatin bridges. We have shown
   previously that the gene mutated in CDA I encodes Codanin-1, a
   ubiquitously expressed and evolutionarily conserved large protein.
   Recently, an additional etiologic factor for CDA I was reported,
   C15Orf41, a predicted nuclease. Mutations in both CDAN1 and C15Orf41
   genes results in very similar erythroid phenotype. However, the possible
   relationships between these two etiologic factors is not clear. Results
   We demonstrate here that Codanin-1 and C15Orf41 bind to each other, and
   that Codanin-1 stabilizes C15Orf41. C15Orf41 protein is mainly nuclear
   and Codanin-1 overexpression shifts it to the cytoplasm. Phylogenetic
   analyses demonstrated that even though Codanin-1 is an essential protein
   in mammals, it was lost from several diverse and unrelated animal taxa.
   Interestingly, C15Orf41 was eliminated in the exact same animal taxa.
   This is an extreme case of the Phylogenetic Profiling phenomenon, which
   strongly suggests common pathways for these two proteins. Lastly, as the
   3D structure is more conserved through evolution than the protein
   sequence, we have used the Phyre2 alignment program to find structurally
   homologous proteins. We found that Codanin-1 is highly similar to CNOT1,
   a conserved protein which serves as a scaffold for proteins involved in
   mRNA stability and transcriptional control. Conclusions The physical
   interaction and the stabilization of C15Orf41 by Codanin-1, combined
   with the phylogenetic co-existence and co-loss of these two proteins
   during evolution, suggest that the major function of the presumptive
   scaffold protein, Codanin-1, is to regulate C15Orf41 activities. The
   similarity between Codanin-1 and CNOT1 suggest that Codanin-1 is
   involved in RNA metabolism and activity, and opens up a new avenue for
   the study of the molecular pathways affected in CDAI.},

Title = {Advanced mare age impairs the ability of in vitro-matured oocytes to
   correctly align chromosomes on the metaphase plate},
Journal = {EQUINE VETERINARY JOURNAL},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {51},
Number = {2},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Background: Advanced mare age is associated with declining fertility and
   an increased risk of early pregnancy loss. Compromised oocyte quality is
   probably the primary reason for reduced fertility, but the defects
   predisposing to embryonic death are unknown. In women, advanced age
   predisposes to chromosome segregation errors during meiosis, which lead
   to embryonic aneuploidy and a heightened risk of miscarriage.
   Objectives: To evaluate the effect of advanced mare age on chromosome
   alignment and meiotic spindle morphology in in vitro-matured (IVM)
   oocytes.
   Study design: Morphometric and morphological analysis.
   Methods: To investigate differences in spindle organisation and
   chromosome alignment between young and old mares, oocytes collected from
   slaughtered mares were divided into two groups depending on mare age
   (young, <= 14 years and old, >= 16 years), IVM and stained to visualise
   chromatin and alpha-tubulin. Spindle morphology, morphometry and
   chromosome (mis) alignment were evaluated by confocal microscopy and 3D
   image analysis.
   Results: Oocytes from old mares showed a higher incidence of chromosome
   misalignment (47.4\% vs. 4.5\%; P<0.001) and a thicker metaphase plate
   (mean +/- s.d.: 5.8 +/- 1.0 mu m vs. 4.9 +/- 0.9 mu m; P = 0.04) than
   oocytes from young mares. Although no differences in spindle morphometry
   were detected between old and young mares, an increased major spindle
   axis length was associated with chromosome misalignment (mean +/- s.d.:
   25.3 +/- 6.1 mu m vs. 20.8 +/- 3.3 mu m; P = 0.01) irrespective of age.
   Main limitations: The oocytes were IVM and may not exactly reflect
   chromosome misalignment in vivo.
   Conclusions: Advanced mare age predisposes to chromosome misalignment on
   the metaphase II spindle of IVM oocytes. The compromised ability to
   correctly align chromosomes presumably predisposes to aneuploidy in
   resulting embryos and thereby contributes to the age-related decline in
   fertility and increased incidence of early pregnancy loss.},

   metastatic NSCLC},
Journal = {THERANOSTICS},

Abstract = {Rationale: 13-catenin is a component for cell adhesion and a
   transcriptional coactivator in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT).
   Previously we found that catalytically active PLK1 drives EMT in
   non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), upregulating extracellular matrix
   factors including TSG6, laminin y2, and CD44. To understand the
   underlying mechanism and clinical significance of PLK1 and 13-catenin in
   NSCLC, their relationship and function in metastatic regulation were
   investigated.Methods: The clinical relevance between the survival rate
   of NSCLC patients and the expression of PLK1 and 13-catenin was analyzed
   by a KM plot. Immunoprecipitation, kinase assay, LC-MS/MS spectrometry,
   and site-directed mutagenesis were performed to reveal their interaction
   and phosphorylation. A lentiviral doxycycline-inducible system,
   Transwell-based 3D culture, tail-vein injection model, confocal
   microscopy, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were used to
   elucidate the function of phosphorylated 13-catenin in the EMT of
   NSCLC.Results: Clinical analysis revealed that the high expression of
   CTNNB1/PLK1 was inversely correlated with the survival rates of 1,292
   NSCLC patients, especially in metastatic NSCLC. In TGF-13-induced or
   active PLK1-driven EMT, 13-catenin, PLK1, TSG6, laminin y2, and CD44
   were concurrently upregulated. 13-catenin is a binding partner of PLK1
   in TGF-13-induced EMT and is phosphorylated at S311. Phosphomimetic
   13-catenin promotes cell motility, invasiveness of NSCLC cells, and
   metastasis in a tail-vein injection mouse model. Its upregulated
   stability by phosphorylation enhances transcriptional activity through
   nuclear translocation for the expression of laminin y2, CD44, and c-Jun,
   therefore enhancing PLK1 expression by AP-1.Conclusions: Our findings
   provide evidence for the critical role of the PLK1/beta-catenin/AP-1
   axis in metastatic NSCLC, implying that 13-catenin and PLK1 may serve as
   a molecular target and prognostic indicator of the therapeutic response
   in metastatic NSCLC patients.},

Title = {Intermediate filaments and nuclear deformability during matrix invasion},
Booktitle = {PHYSICS OF CANCER, VOL 1: INTERPLAY BETWEEN TUMOR BIOLOGY, INFLAMMATION
   AND CELL MECHANICS, 2ND EDITION},
Series = {IOP Expanding Physics},
Year = {2018},
Abstract = {Intermediate filaments belong to one of the three major classes of
   intracellular filaments and are hence an important component of the
   cellular cytoskeleton. The first role of intermediate filaments is their
   support of the mechanical properties of the cells. Intermediate filament
   proteins can assemble to produce polymers that build viscoelastic gels.
   Intermediate filament networks display a striking nonlinear elasticity
   with increasing stiffness that has been quantified by analyzing the
   shear modulus, which can even increase by an order of magnitude when the
   networks are probed by large stains. It is clear that intermediate
   filaments fulfill many different roles, regulating a broad variety of
   biological functions, such as the organization and assembly of
   microtubules and microfilaments, the regulation of nuclear structure and
   the connection of the chromatin to the nuclear lamina, and subsequently
   they facilitate the regulation of the activity of genes, the cell cycle
   and signal transduction pathways. This chapter introduces and discusses
   the role of intermediate filaments and nuclear deformability, including
   how they may affect cell matrix invasion through connective tissue.
   Special emphasis is placed on the role of intermediate filaments in
   providing cytoskeletal and nuclear stiffness and hence supporting
   cellular motility. As intermediate filaments are integrated into a broad
   cytoskeletal and nuclear network, the interaction between them and actin
   filaments in supporting cell motility is highlighted. In addition to
   cellular motility regulation, the strong involvement of intermediate
   filament proteins in the regulation of intracellular trafficking has
   been established, as they associate with key proteins of the vesicular
   membrane transport machinery and subsequently of the endocytic pathway.
   Moreover, a number of intermediate filament proteins have been
   identified to function in the acquisition of tumorigenic properties.
   Finally, it is suggested that cancer cells may overcome the steric
   restrictions of dense 3D extracellular matrix fiber networks by
   undergoing mitosis and thereby restructuring their entire cytoskeleton
   including the intermediate filament network.},

Title = {Reduced Lamin A/C Does Not Facilitate Cancer Cell Transendothelial
   Migration but Compromises Lung Metastasis},
Journal = {CANCERS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Simple Summary
   The nucleus is the largest and stiffest organelle of tumor cells. Cancer
   metastasis depends on the ability of cancer cells circulating in the
   blood to exit blood vessels and survive in target organs. The roles of
   the shell (lamina) of the nucleus in cancer cell migration and survival
   in distinct organs of metastasis are still unclear. A-type lamins are
   key lamina components that increase nuclear stiffness and reduce
   squeezing capacity through highly rigid barriers. We addressed how
   reduced expression of A-lamins (lamin A/C) affects cancer cell survival
   and crossing of endothelial barriers and lung capillaries and found that
   reduced lamin A/C expression impairs cancer growth in spheroids and
   restricts cancer metastasis to lungs without improving cancer cell
   squeezing and extravasation from lung vessels, the key platform for
   cancer entry into lungs.
   The mechanisms by which the nuclear lamina of tumor cells influences
   tumor growth and migration are highly disputed. Lamin A and its variant
   lamin C are key lamina proteins that control nucleus stiffness and
   chromatin conformation. Downregulation of lamin A/C in two prototypic
   metastatic lines, B16F10 melanoma and E0771 breast carcinoma,
   facilitated cell squeezing through rigid pores, and reduced
   heterochromatin content. Surprisingly, both lamin A/C knockdown cells
   grew poorly in 3D spheroids within soft agar, and lamin A/C deficient
   cells derived from spheroids transcribed lower levels of the growth
   regulator Yap1. Unexpectedly, the transendothelial migration of both
   cancer cells in vitro and in vivo, through lung capillaries, was not
   elevated by lamin A/C knockdown and their metastasis in lungs was even
   dramatically reduced. Our results are the first indication that reduced
   lamin A/C content in distinct types of highly metastatic cancer cells
   does not elevate their transendothelial migration (TEM) capacity and
   diapedesis through lung vessels but can compromise lung metastasis at a
   post extravasation level.},

Title = {Biophysics is reshaping our perception of the epigenome: from DNA-level
   to high-throughput studies},
Journal = {BIOPHYSICAL REPORTS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {1},
Number = {2},
Month = {DEC 8},
Abstract = {Epigenetic research holds great promise to advance our understanding of
   biomarkers and regulatory processes in health and disease. An increasing
   number of new approaches, ranging from molecular to biophysical
   analyses, enable identifying epigenetic changes on the level of a single
   gene or the whole epigenome. The aim of this review is to highlight how
   the field is shifting from completely molecular-biology-driven solutions
   to multidisciplinary strategies including more reliance on biophysical
   analysis tools. Biophysics not only offers technical advancements in
   imaging or structure analysis but also helps to explore regulatory
   interactions. New computational methods are also being developed to meet
   the demand of growing data volumes and their processing. Therefore, it
   is important to capture these new directions in epigenetics from a
   biophysical perspective and discuss current challenges as well as
   multiple applications of biophysical methods and tools. Specifically, we
   gradually introduce different biophysical research methods by first
   considering the DNA-level information and eventually higher-order
   chromatin structures. Moreover, we aim to highlight that the
   incorporation of bioinformatics, machine learning, and artificial
   intelligence into biophysical analysis allows gaining new insights into
   complex epigenetic processes. The gained understanding has already
   proven useful in translational and clinical research providing better
   patient stratification options or new therapeutic insights. Together,
   this offers a better readiness to transform bench-top experiments into
   industrial high-throughput applications with a possibility to employ
   developed methods in clinical practice and diagnostics.},

Title = {Effects of Culture Condition on Epigenomic Profiles of Brain Tumor Cells},
Journal = {ACS BIOMATERIALS SCIENCE \& ENGINEERING},

Abstract = {Personalized cancer medicine offers the promise of more effective
   treatments that are tailored to an individual's own dynamic cancer
   phenotype. Meanwhile, tissue-engineering approaches to modeling tumors
   may complement these advances by providing powerful new strategies for
   understanding the adaptation dynamics occurring during treatment.
   However, in both of these areas, new tools will be required to gain a
   full picture of the genetic and epigenetic regulators of phenotype
   dynamics occurring in the small populations of cells that drive
   resistance. In this study, we perform epigenomic analysis of brain tumor
   cells that are collected from microengineered three-dimensional tumor
   models, overcoming the challenges associated with the small numbers of
   cells contained within these microtissue niches, in this case collecting
   1000 cells per sample. Specifically, we use a high-resolution epigenomic
   analysis method known as microfluidic-oscillatory-washing-based
   chromatin immunoprecipitation with sequencing (MOWChIP-seq) to analyze
   histone modification patterns (H3K4me3). We identified gene loci that
   are associated with the H3K4me3 modification, which is generally a mark
   of active transcription. We compared H3K4me3 profiles in standard 2D
   cultures and 3D cultures based on type I collagen hydrogels, under both
   normoxic and hypoxic conditions. We found that culture dimensionality
   drastically impacted the H3k4me3 profile and resulted in differential
   modifications in response to hypoxic stress. Differentially
   H3K4me3-marked regions under the culture conditions used in this study
   have important implications for gene expression differences that have
   been previously observed. In total, our work illustrates a direct
   connection between cell culture or tissue niche condition and
   genome-wide alterations in histone modifications, providing the first
   steps toward analyzing the spatiotemporal variations in epigenetic
   regulation of cancer cell phenotypes. This study, to the best of our
   knowledge, also represents the first time broad-spectrum epigenomic
   analysis has been applied to small cell samples collected from
   engineered microtissues.},

Title = {A new gene inventory of the ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like conjugation
   pathways in <i>Giardia intestinalis</i>},
Journal = {MEMORIAS DO INSTITUTO OSWALDO CRUZ},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {115},
Abstract = {BACKGROUND Ubiquitin (Ub) and Ub-like proteins (Ub-L) are critical
   regulators of complex cellular processes such as the cell cycle, DNA
   repair, transcription, chromatin remodeling, signal translation, and
   protein degradation. Giardia intestinalis possesses an experimentally
   proven Ub-conjugation system; however, a limited number of enzymes
   involved in this process were identified using basic local alignment
   search tool (BLAST). This is due to the limitations of BLAST's ability
   to identify homologous functional regions when similarity between the
   sequences dips to < 30\%. In addition Ub-Ls and their conjugating
   enzymes have not been fully elucidated in Giardia.
   OBJETIVE To identify the enzymes involved in the Ub and Ub-Ls
   conjugation processes using intelligent systems based on the hidden
   Markov models (HMMs).
   METHODS We performed an HMM search of functional Pfam domains found in
   the key enzymes of these pathways in Giardia's proteome. Each open
   reading frame identified was analysed by sequence homology, domain
   architecture, and transcription levels.
   FINDINGS We identified 118 genes, 106 of which corresponded to the
   ubiquitination process (Ub, E1, E2, E3, and DUB enzymes). The F3 ligase
   group was the largest group with 82 members; 71 of which harbored a
   characteristic RING domain. Four Ub-Ls were identified and the
   conjugation enzymes for NEDD8 and URMI were described for first time.
   The 3D model for Ub-Ls displayed the beta-grasp fold typical.
   Furthermore, our sequence analysis for the corresponding activating
   enzymes detected the essential motifs required for conjugation.
   MAIN CONCLUSIONS Our findings highlight the complexity of Giardia's
   Ub-conjugation system, which is drastically different from that
   previously reported, and provides evidence for the presence of
   NEDDylation and URMylation enzymes in the genome and transcriptome of G.

Title = {A CON-based NMR assignment strategy for pro-rich intrinsically
   disordered proteins with low signal dispersion: the C-terminal domain of
   histone H1.0 as a case study},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BIOMOLECULAR NMR},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {72},
Number = {3-4},
Pages = {139-148},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The C-terminal domain of histone H1.0 (C-H1.0) is involved in DNA
   binding and is a main determinant of the chromatin condensing properties
   of histone H1.0. Phosphorylation at the (S/T)-P-X-(K/R) motifs affects
   DNA binding and is crucial for regulation of C-H1.0 function. Since
   C-H1.0 is an intrinsically disordered domain, solution NMR is an
   excellent approach to characterize the effect of phosphorylation on the
   structural and dynamic properties of C-H1.0. However, its very
   repetitive, low-amino acid-diverse and Pro-rich sequence, together with
   the low signal dispersion observed at the H-1-N-15 HSQC spectra of both
   non- and tri-phosphorylated C-H1.0 preclude the use of standard
   H-1-detected assignment strategies. We have achieved an essentially
   complete assignment of the heavy backbone atoms (N-15, C-13 and C-13),
   as well as H-1(N) and C-13 nuclei, of non- and tri-phosphorylated C-H1.0
   by applying a novel C-13-detected CON-based strategy. No C-H1.0 region
   with a clear secondary structure tendency was detected by chemical shift
   analyses, confirming at residue level that C-H1.0 is disordered in
   aqueous solution. Phosphorylation only affected the chemical shifts of
   phosphorylated Thr's, and their adjacent residues. Heteronuclear
   \{H-1\}-N-15 NOEs were also essentially equal in the non- and
   tri-phosphorylated states. Hence, structural tendencies and dynamic
   properties of C-H1.0 free in aqueous solution are unmodified by
   phosphorylation. We propose that the assignment strategy used for
   C-H1.0, which is based on the acquisition of only a few 3D spectra, is
   an excellent choice for short-lived intrinsically disordered proteins
   with repetitive sequences.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF DERMATOLOGICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {78},
Number = {3},
Pages = {189-196},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Background: CLCA was postulated to be a calcium-activated chloride
   channel accessory protein. Recent reports indicate that CLCA isoforms
   are likely to be expressed in different layers of the stratified
   epithelium of the skin.
   Objective: The present study investigated the transcriptional mechanism
   by which murine CLCA2 (mCLCA2) is expressed in the transformed
   keratinocyte line Pam212 that can differentiate.
   Methods: A luciferase reporter assay, chromatin immunoprecipitation
   (ChIP) assay, reverse transcription-PCR, and immunocytochemistry were
   performed using Pam212 cells.
   Results: Promoter activity of mCLCA2 was inhibited profoundly by
   site-directed mutagenesis of a putative nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa
   B) binding site and by treatment with siRNA against p65. ChIP and
   transcription factor assays showed the specific association of
   endogenously activated p65 protein with the NF-kappa B binding domain.
   As confirmed by the nuclear translocation of p65, tumor necrosis factor
   alpha and caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) increased and decreased
   mCLCA2 promoter activity, respectively, but exhibited modest effects on
   endogenous mCLCA2 expression in cells in culture medium containing 0.05
   mM Ca2+ . When the Ca2+ concentration was raised to 1.0 mM, the mRNA and
   protein levels of mCLCA2 increased as well as those of the
   differentiation markers keratin 1 (K1) and K10. CAPE profoundly
   suppressed only the Ca2+-triggered expression of mCLCA2, not K1 or K10.
   Immunohistochemistry of native skin and organotypic 3D cultures
   confirmed the distribution of the CLCA2 homolog in differentiated cells.
   Conclusion: The present study revealed for the first time that basal
   NF-kappa B activity is involved in the Ca2+-dependent regulation of
   mCLCA2 expression in a mouse keratinocyte line. (C) 2015 Japanese

Title = {A Toll-Like Receptor 2 Pathway Regulates the <i>Ppargc1a</i>/<i>b</i>
   Metabolic Co-Activators in Mice with <i>Staphylococcal aureus</i> Sepsis},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {6},

Month = {SEP 26},
Abstract = {Activation of the host antibacterial defenses by the toll-like receptors
   (TLR) also selectively activates energy-sensing and metabolic pathways,
   but the mechanisms are poorly understood. This includes the metabolic
   and mitochondrial biogenesis master co-activators, Ppargc1a (PGC-1
   alpha) and Ppargc1b (PGC-1 beta) in Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus)
   sepsis. The expression of these genes in the liver is markedly
   attenuated in TLR2(-/-) mice and markedly accentuated in TLR4(-/-) mice
   compared with wild type (WT) mice. We sought to explain this difference
   by using specific TLR-pathway knockout mice to test the hypothesis that
   these co-activator genes are directly regulated through TLR2 signaling.
   By comparing their responses to S. aureus with WT mice, we found that
   MyD88-deficient and MAL-deficient mice expressed hepatic Ppargc1a and
   Ppargc1b normally, but that neither gene was activated in TRAM-deficient
   mice. Ppargc1a/b activation did not require NF-k beta, but did require
   an interferon response factor (IRF), because neither gene was activated
   in IRF-3/7 double-knockout mice in sepsis, but both were activated
   normally in Unc93b1-deficient (3d) mice. Nuclear IRF-7 levels in
   TLR2(-/-) and TLR4(-/-) mice decreased and increased respectively
   post-inoculation and IRF-7 DNA-binding at the Ppargc1a promoter was
   demonstrated by chromatin immunoprecipitation. Also, a TLR2-TLR4-TRAM
   native hepatic protein complex was detected by immunoprecipitation
   within 6 h of S. aureus inoculation that could support MyD88-independent
   signaling to Ppargc1a/b. Overall, these findings disclose a novel
   MyD88-independent pathway in S. aureus sepsis that links TLR2 and TLR4
   signaling in innate immunity to Ppargc1a/b gene regulation in a critical
   metabolic organ, the liver, by means of TRAM, TRIF, and IRF-7.},

Title = {Nuclear organization in differentiating oligodendrocytes},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CELL SCIENCE},
Year = {2002},
Volume = {115},
Number = {21},
Pages = {4071-4079},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {Many studies have suggested that the 3D organization of chromatin and
   proteins within the nucleus contributes to the regulation of gene
   expression. We tested multiple aspects of this nuclear organization
   model within a primary cell culture system. Oligodendrocyte lineage
   cells were examined to facilitate analysis of nuclear organization
   relative to a highly expressed tissue-specific gene, proteolipid protein
   (PLP), which exhibits transcriptional upregulation during
   differentiation from the immature progenitor stage to the mature
   oligodendrocyte stage. Oligodendrocyte lineage cells were isolated from
   brains of neonatal male rodents, and differentiation from
   oligodendrocyte progenitors to mature oligodendrocytes was controlled
   with culture conditions. Genomic in situ hybridization was used to
   detect the single copy of the X-linked PLP gene within each interphase
   nucleus. The PLP gene was not randomly distributed within the nucleus,
   but was consistently associated with the nuclear periphery in both
   progenitors and differentiated oligodendrocytes. PLP and a second
   simultaneously upregulated gene, the myelin basic protein (MBP) gene,
   were spatially separated in both progenitors and differentiated
   oligodendrocytes. Increased transcriptional activity of the PLP gene in
   differentiated oligodendrocytes corresponded with local accumulation of
   SC35 splicing factors. Differentiation did not alter the frequency of
   association of the PLP gene with domains of myelin transcription factor
   1 (Myt1), which binds the PLP promoter. In addition to our specific
   findings related to the PLP gene, these data obtained from primary
   oligodendrocyte lineage cells support a nuclear organization model in
   which (1) nuclear proteins and genes can exhibit specific patterns of
   distribution within nuclei, and (2) activation of tissue-specific genes
   is associated with changes in local protein distribution rather than
   spatial clustering of coordinately regulated genes. This nuclear
   organization may be critical for complex nucleic-acid-protein
   interactions controlling normal cell development, and may be an
   important factor in aberrant regulation of cell differentiation and gene
   expression in transformed cells.},

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY},
Year = {2023},

Abstract = {IntroductionAfrican American (AA) men exhibited 2.3-fold higher PCa
   incidence and 1.7-fold higher PCa mortality rates when compared to the
   European American (EA) men. Besides the socioeconomic factors, emerging
   evidence has highlighted that biological risk factors may play critical
   roles in the AA PCa disparities. Previously, we have shown that
   downregulated miR-99b-5p and upregulated mTOR cooperatively promotes the
   AA PCa aggressiveness and drug resistance.MethodsIn this study, we aimed
   to explore the miR-99b-5p/mTOR/AR/SMARCD1 signaling axis in AA PCa
   aggressiveness. The analyses used in the study included
   immunofluorescence, western blot, in-vitro functional assays (TUNEL,
   colony forming, and MTT), and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-qPCR
   assays in 2D and/or 3D culture model of EA PCa and AA PCa cell
   lines.ResultsSpecifically, the immunofluorescence staining, and western
   blot analysis has revealed that nuclear mTOR, AR, and SMARCD1 were
   highly expressed in AA PCa (MDA PCa 2b) compared to EA PCa (LNCaP) cell
   line. Western blot analysis further revealed that miR-99b-5p inhibited
   protein levels of mTOR, AR/AR-V7 and SMARCD1 in cytoplasm and nuclei of
   EA and AA PCa. The in-vitro functional (MTT, TUNEL, and clonogenic)
   assays have demonstrated that miR-99b-5p effectively inhibited cell
   proliferation/survival and induced cell apoptosis in EA and AA PCa
   cells. Moreover, combination of miR-99b-5p and enzalutamide (Enz)
   synergistically enhances the cytotoxicity against aggressive AA PCa and
   castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). mTOR ChIP-qPCR assays
   further demonstrated that miR-99b-5p or miR-99b-5p/Enz significantly
   reduces the recruitment of mTOR to the genes involved in the metabolic
   reprogramming in CRPC.DiscussionTaken together, miR-99b-5p may function
   as an epigenomic driver to modulate the mTOR/AR/SMARCD1 signaling axis
   in AA PCa and resistant CRPC.},

Title = {<i>Cryptosporidium parvum</i>-induced neutrophil extracellular traps in
   neonatal calves is a stage-independent process},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN VETERINARY SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {10},
Month = {AUG 17},
Abstract = {Introduction Infections with the apicomplexan obligate intracellular
   parasite Cryptosporidium parvum lead to cryptosporidiosis-a worldwide
   zoonotic infection. C. parvum is one of the most common diarrheal
   pathogens in young calves, which are the main reservoir of the pathogen.
   Cryptosporidiosis leads to severe economic losses in the calf industry
   and being a major contributor to diarrhea morbidity and mortality in
   children. Polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) are part of the innate
   immune system. Their effector mechanisms directed against invasive
   parasites include phagocytosis, production of antimicrobial molecules as
   well as the formation of so-called neutrophil extracellular traps
   (NETs). Like other leukocytes of the innate immune system, PMN are thus
   able to release chromatin fibers enriched with antimicrobial granular
   molecules extracellularly thereby immobilizing and partially killing
   invasive bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites.Methods In vitro
   interactions of neonatal bovine PMN and C. parvum-oocysts and
   sporozoites were illustrated microscopically via scanning electron
   microscopy- and live cell imaging 3D holotomographic microscopy
   analyses. C. parvum-triggered NETosis was quantified via extracellular
   DNA measurements as well as verified via detection of NET-typical
   molecules {[}histones, neutrophil elastase (NE)] through
   immunofluorescence microscopy analysis. To verify the role of ATP in
   neonatal-derived NETosis, inhibition experiments were performed with
   NF449 (purinergic receptor antagonist with high specificity to P2X1
   receptor).Results and discussion Using immunofluorescence- and SEM-based
   analyses, we demonstrate here for the first time that neonate bovine PMN
   are capable of forming NETs against C. parvum-sporozoites and oocysts,
   thus as a stage-independent cell death process. Our data further showed
   that C. parvum strongly induces suicidal neonatal NETosis in a
   P2X1-dependent manner, suggesting anti-cryptosporidial effects not only
   through firm sporozoite ensnarement and hampered sporozoite excystation,
   but also via direct exposure to NETs-associated toxic components.},

Abstract = {AIB1 Delta 4 is an N-terminally truncated isoform of the oncogene
   amplified in breast cancer 1 (AIB1) with increased expression in
   high-grade human ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). However, the role of
   AIB1 Delta 4 in DCIS malignant progression has not been defined. Here we
   CRISPR-engineered RNA splice junctions to produce normal and early-stage
   DCIS breast epithelial cells that expressed only AIB1 Delta 4. These
   cells showed enhanced motility and invasion in 3D cell culture. In
   zebrafish, AIB1 Delta 4-expressing cells enabled invasion of parental
   cells when present in a mixed population. In mouse xenografts, a
   subpopulation of AIB1 Delta 4 cells mixed with parental cells enhanced
   tumor growth, recurrence, and lung metastasis. AIB1 Delta 4 chromatin
   immunoprecipitation sequencing revealed enhanced binding to regions
   including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) and
   glucocorticoid receptor (GR) genomic recognition sites. H3K27ac and
   H3K4me1 genomic engagement patterns revealed selective activation of
   breast cancer-specific enhancer sites by AIB1 Delta 4. AIB1 Delta 4
   cells displayed upregulated inflammatory response genes and
   downregulated PPAR signaling gene expression patterns. In the presence
   of AIB1 Delta 4 enabler cells, parental cells increased NF-kappa B and
   WNT signaling. Cellular crosstalk was inhibited by the PPAR gamma
   agonist efatutazone but was enhanced by treatment with the GR agonist
   dexamethasone. In conclusion, expression of the AIB1 Delta 4-selective
   cistrome in a small subpopulation of cells triggers an ``enabler{''}
   phenotype hallmarked by an invasive transcriptional program and
   collective malignant progression in a heterogeneous tumor population.
   Significance: A minor subset of early-stage breast cancer cells
   expressing AIB1 Delta 4 enables bulk tumor cells to become invasive,
   suggesting that selective eradication of this population could impair
   breast cancer metastasis.

Abstract = {The P genome of Agropyron Gaertn., a wild relative of wheat, contains an
   abundance of desirable genes that can be utilized as genetic resources
   to improve wheat. In this study, wheat - Aegliops cylindrica Host
   gametocidal chromosome 2C addition lines were crossed with wheat
   Agropyron cristatum (L.) Gaertn. disomic addition line accession II-21
   with alien recombinant chromosome (1.4)P. We successfully induced wheat
   A. cristatum alien chromosomal translocations for the first time. The
   frequency of translocation in the progeny was 3.75\%, which was detected
   by molecular markers and genomic in situ hybridization (GISH). The
   translocation chromosomes were identified by dual-color GISH
   /fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). The P genomic DNA was used
   as probe to detect the (1.4)P chromosome fragment, and pHvG39, pAs1, or
   pSc119.2 repeated sequences were used as probes to identify wheat
   translocated chromosomes. The results showed that six types of
   translocations were identified in the three wheat A. cristatum alien
   translocation lines, including the whole arm or terminal portion of a
   (1.4)P chromosome. The (1.4)P chromosome fragments were translocated to
   wheat chromosomes 1B, 2B, 5B, and 3D. The breakpoints were located at
   the centromeres of 1B and 2B, the pericentric locations of 5BS, and the
   terminals of 5BL and 3DS. In addition, we obtained 12 addition deletion
   lines that contained alien A. cristatum chromosome (1.4)P in wheat
   background. All of these wheat A. cristatum alien translocation lines
   and addition deletion lines would be valuable for identifying A.
   cristatum chromosome (1.4)P-related genes and providing genetic
   resources and new germplasm accessions for the genetic improvement of
   wheat. The specific molecular markers of A. cristatum (1.4)P chromosome
   have been developed and used to track the (1.4)P chromatin.},

Abstract = {Development and homeostasis of multicellular organisms relies on an
   intricate balance between cell proliferation and differentiation.
   Geminin regulates the cell cycle by directly binding and inhibiting the
   DNA replication licensing factor Cdt1. Geminin also interacts with
   transcriptional regulators of differentiation and chromatin remodelling
   factors, and its balanced interactions are implicated in
   proliferation-differentiation decisions during development. Here, we
   describe Idas (Idas being a cousin of the Gemini in Ancient Greek
   Mythology), a previously uncharacterised coiled-coil protein related to
   Geminin. We show that human Idas localizes to the nucleus, forms a
   complex with Geminin both in cells and in vitro through coiled-coil
   mediated interactions, and can change Geminin subcellular localization.
   Idas does not associate with Cdt1 and prevents Geminin from binding to
   Cdt1 in vitro. Idas depletion from cells affects cell cycle progression;
   cells accumulate in S phase and are unable to efficiently progress to
   mitosis. Idas protein levels decrease in anaphase, whereas its
   overexpression causes mitotic defects. During development, we show that
   Idas exhibits high level expression in the choroid plexus and the
   cortical hem of the mouse telencephalon. Our data highlight Idas as a
   novel Geminin binding partner, implicated in cell cycle progression, and
   a putative regulator of proliferation-differentiation decisions during
   development.},

Title = {DiffDomain enables identification of structurally reorganized
   topologically associating domains},
Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {15},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 13},
Abstract = {Topologically associating domains (TADs) are critical structural units
   in three-dimensional genome organization of mammalian genome. Dynamic
   reorganizations of TADs between health and disease states are associated
   with essential genome functions. However, computational methods for
   identifying reorganized TADs are still in the early stages of
   development. Here, we present DiffDomain, an algorithm leveraging
   high-dimensional random matrix theory to identify structurally
   reorganized TADs using high-throughput chromosome conformation capture
   (Hi-C) contact maps. Method comparison using multiple real Hi-C datasets
   reveals that DiffDomain outperforms alternative methods for false
   positive rates, true positive rates, and identifying a new subtype of
   reorganized TADs. Applying DiffDomain to Hi-C data from different cell
   types and disease states demonstrates its biological relevance.
   Identified reorganized TADs are associated with structural variations
   and epigenomic changes such as changes in CTCF binding sites. By
   applying to a single-cell Hi-C data from mouse neuronal development,
   DiffDomain can identify reorganized TADs between cell types with
   reasonable reproducibility using pseudo-bulk Hi-C data from as few as
   100 cells per condition. Moreover, DiffDomain reveals differential
   cell-to-population variability and heterogeneous cell-to-cell
   variability in TADs. Therefore, DiffDomain is a statistically sound
   method for better comparative analysis of TADs using both Hi-C and
   single-cell Hi-C data.
   Topologically associating domains (TADs) are critical structural units
   in 3D genome organization, and their reorganization between health and
   disease states is associated with essential genome functions. However,
   computational methods for identifying reorganized TADs are still in the
   early stages of development. Here, the authors present an algorithm
   leveraging random matrix theory to identify reorganized TADs.},

Title = {A genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screen identifies essential and
   growth-restricting genes in human trophoblast stem cells},
Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAY 10},
Abstract = {The recent derivation of human trophoblast stem cells (hTSCs) provides a
   scalable in vitro model system of human placental development, but the
   molecular regulators of hTSC identity have not been systematically
   explored thus far. Here, we utilize a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 knockout
   screen to comprehensively identify essential and growth-restricting
   genes in hTSCs. By cross-referencing our data to those from similar
   genetic screens performed in other cell types, as well as gene
   expression data from early human embryos, we define hTSC-specific and
   -enriched regulators. These include both well-established and previously
   uncharacterized trophoblast regulators, such as ARID3A, GATA2, and TEAD1
   (essential), and GCM1, PTPN14, and TET2 (growth-restricting). Integrated
   analysis of chromatin accessibility, gene expression, and genome-wide
   location data reveals that the transcription factor TEAD1 regulates the
   expression of many trophoblast regulators in hTSCs. In the absence of
   TEAD1, hTSCs fail to complete faithful differentiation into extravillous
   trophoblast (EVT) cells and instead show a bias towards
   syncytiotrophoblast (STB) differentiation, thus indicating that this
   transcription factor safeguards the bipotent lineage potential of hTSCs.
   Overall, our study provides a valuable resource for dissecting the
   molecular regulation of human placental development and diseases.
   Here the authors perform a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screen to
   systematically identify and characterize essential and
   growth-restricting genes in human trophoblast cells. They identify TEAD1
   as a key regulator that plays an important role in the specification,
   maintenance, and differentiation of the human trophoblast lineage by
   modulating chromatin architecture and gene expression.},

Title = {Three-Dimensional Nanostructure of an Intact Microglia Cell},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN NEUROANATOMY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {12},
Month = {DEC 5},
Abstract = {Microglia are non-neuronal cells of themyeloid lineage that invade and
   take up long-term residence in the brain during development (Ginhoux et
   al., 2010) and are increasingly implicated in neuronal maturation,
   homeostasis, and pathology (Bessis et al., 2007; Paolicelli et al.,
   2011; Li et al., 2012; Aguzzi et al., 2013; Cunningham, 2013; Cunningham
   et al., 2013). Since the early twentieth century several methods for
   staining and visualizing microglia have been developed. Scientists in
   Ramon y Cajal's group (Achucarro, 1913; Rio-Hortega, 1919) pioneered
   these methods and their work led to the christening of microglia as the
   third element of the nervous system, distinct from astrocytes and
   neurons. More recently, a combination of imaging, genetic, and
   immunological tools has been used to visualize microglia in living brain
   (Davalos et al., 2005; Nimmerjahn et al., 2005). It was found that
   microglia are highly motile under resting conditions and rapidly respond
   to injuries (Kettenmann et al., 2011) suggesting a role for microglia in
   both brain homeostasis and pathology. Transmission Electron microscopy
   (TEM) has provided crucial complementary information on microglia
   morphology and physiology but until recently EM analyses have been
   limited to single or limited serial section studies (Tremblay et al.,
   2010, 2012; Paolicelli et al., 2011; Schafer et al., 2012; Sipe et al.,
   2016). TEM studies were successful in defining a set of morphological
   criteria for microglia: a polygonal nucleus with peripheral condensed
   chromatin, a relatively small cytoplasm with abundant presence of rough
   endoplasmic reticulum (RER), and a large volume of lysosomes and
   inclusions in the perikaryon. Recent advances in volumetric electron
   microscopy techniques allow for 3D reconstruction of large samples at
   nanometer-resolution, thus opening up new avenues for the understanding
   of cell biology and architecture in intact tissues. At the same time,
   correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM) techniques have been
   extended to 3D brain samples to help navigate and identify critical
   molecular landmarks within large EM volumes (Briggman and Denk, 2006;
   Maco et al., 2013; Blazquez-Llorca et al., 2015; Bosch et al., 2015).
   Here we present the first volumetric ultrastructural reconstruction of a
   nearly complete mouse hippocampal microglia using serial block face
   scanning electronmicroscopy (SBEM). Imaging was performed on amouse at
   early postnatal stage (P15) in CA1 stratumradiatum. Using CLEM we have
   ensured the inclusion of both large, small, and filopodial microglia
   processes. Segmentation of the dataset allowed us to carry out a
   comprehensive inventory of microglia cell structures, including
   vesicles, organelles, membrane protrusions, and processes. This study
   provides a reference that can serve as a data mining resource for

Title = {Potential roles of inter-chromosomal interactions in cell fate
   determination},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN CELL AND DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {12},
Month = {MAY 7},
Abstract = {Mammalian genomic DNA is packed in a small nucleus, and its folding and
   organization in the nucleus are critical for gene regulation and cell
   fate determination. In interphase, chromosomes are compartmentalized
   into certain nuclear spaces and territories that are considered
   incompatible with each other. The regulation of gene expression is
   influenced by the epigenetic characteristics of topologically associated
   domains and A/B compartments within chromosomes (intrachromosomal).
   Previously, interactions among chromosomes detected via chromosome
   conformation capture-based methods were considered noise or artificial
   errors. However, recent studies based on newly developed
   ligation-independent methods have shown that inter-chromosomal
   interactions play important roles in gene regulation. This review
   summarizes the recent understanding of spatial genomic organization in
   mammalian interphase nuclei and discusses the potential mechanisms that
   determine cell identity. In addition, this review highlights the
   potential role of inter-chromosomal interactions in early mouse
   development.},

Title = {Enhancer selectivity in space and time: from enhancer-promoter
   interactions to promoter activation},
Journal = {NATURE REVIEWS MOLECULAR CELL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 FEB 27},
Abstract = {The primary regulators of metazoan gene expression are enhancers,
   originally functionally defined as DNA sequences that can activate
   transcription at promoters in an orientation-independent and
   distance-independent manner. Despite being crucial for gene regulation
   in animals, what mechanisms underlie enhancer selectivity for promoters,
   and more fundamentally, how enhancers interact with promoters and
   activate transcription, remain poorly understood. In this Review, we
   first discuss current models of enhancer-promoter interactions in space
   and time and how enhancers affect transcription activation. Next, we
   discuss different mechanisms that mediate enhancer selectivity,
   including repression, biochemical compatibility and regulation of 3D
   genome structure. Through 3D polymer simulations, we illustrate how the
   ability of 3D genome folding mechanisms to mediate enhancer selectivity
   strongly varies for different enhancer-promoter interaction mechanisms.
   Finally, we discuss how recent technical advances may provide new
   insights into mechanisms of enhancer-promoter interactions and how
   technical biases in methods such as Hi-C and Micro-C and imaging
   techniques may affect their interpretation.
   Gene regulation in animals depends chiefly on enhancers, yet the
   underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. This Review discusses
   enhancer-promoter interactions and transcription activation, focusing on
   how enhancer-promoter selectivity is achieved and on recent technical
   advances that may provide new insights into transcription activation.},

Title = {Recruitment of 53BP1 Proteins for DNA Repair and Persistence of Repair
   Clusters Differ for Cell Types as Detected by Single Molecule
   Localization Microscopy},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES},
Year = {2018},

Abstract = {DNA double stranded breaks (DSBs) are the most serious type of lesions
   introduced into chromatin by ionizing radiation. During DSB repair,
   cells recruit different proteins to the damaged sites in a manner
   dependent on local chromatin structure, DSB location in the nucleus, and
   the repair pathway entered. 53BP1 is one of the important players
   participating in repair pathway decision of the cell. Although many
   molecular biology details have been investigated, the architecture of
   53BP1 repair foci and its development during the post-irradiation time,
   especially the period of protein recruitment, remains to be elucidated.
   Super-resolution light microscopy is a powerful new tool to approach
   such studies in 3D-conserved cell nuclei. Recently, we demonstrated the
   applicability of single molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) as one
   of these highly resolving methods for analyses of dynamic repair protein
   distribution and repair focus internal nano-architecture in intact cell
   nuclei. In the present study, we focused our investigation on 53BP1 foci
   in differently radio-resistant cell types, moderately radio-resistant
   neonatal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDF) and highly radio-resistant U87
   glioblastoma cells, exposed to high-LET N-15-ion radiation. At given
   time points up to 24 h post irradiation with doses of 1.3 Gy and 4.0 Gy,
   the coordinates and spatial distribution of fluorescently tagged 53BP1
   molecules was quantitatively evaluated at the resolution of 10-20 nm.
   Clusters of these tags were determined as sub-units of repair foci
   according to SMLM parameters. The formation and relaxation of such
   clusters was studied. The higher dose generated sufficient numbers of
   DNA breaks to compare the post-irradiation dynamics of 53BP1 during DSB
   processing for the cell types studied. A perpendicular (90 degrees)
   irradiation scheme was used with the 4.0 Gy dose to achieve better
   separation of a relatively high number of particle tracks typically
   crossing each nucleus. For analyses along ion-tracks, the dose was
   reduced to 1.3 Gy and applied in combination with a sharp angle
   irradiation (10 degrees relative to the cell plane). The results reveal
   a higher ratio of 53BP1 proteins recruited into SMLM defined clusters in
   fibroblasts as compared to U87 cells. Moreover, the speed of foci and
   thus cluster formation and relaxation also differed for the cell types.
   In both NHDF and U87 cells, a certain number of the detected and
   functionally relevant clusters remained persistent even 24 h post
   irradiation; however, the number of these clusters again varied for the
   cell types. Altogether, our findings indicate that repair cluster
   formation as determined by SMLM and the relaxation (i.e., the remaining
   53BP1 tags no longer fulfill the cluster definition) is cell type
   dependent and may be functionally explained and correlated to cell
   specific radio-sensitivity. The present study demonstrates that SMLM is
   a highly appropriate method for investigations of spatiotemporal protein
   organization in cell nuclei and how it influences the cell decision for
   a particular repair pathway at a given DSB site.},

Abstract = {Upstream binding transcription factor (UBTF) is a co-regulator of RNA
   polymerase I by constituting an initiation complex on rRNA genes. UBTF
   plays a role in rDNA bending and its maintenance in ``open{''} state. It
   exists as two splicing variants, UBTF1 and UBTF2, which cannot be
   discerned with antibodies raised against UBTF. We investigated the
   ultrastructural localization of each variant in cells synthesizing
   GFP-tagged UBTF1 or UBTF2 by using anti-GFP antibodies and pre-embedding
   nanogold strategy. Detailed 3D distribution of UBTF1 and 2 was also
   studied by electron tomography. In control cells, the two isoforms are
   very abundant within fibrillar centers, but their repartition strongly
   differs. Electron tomography shows that UBTF1 is disposed as fibrils
   that are folded in coils whereas UBTF2 is localized homogenously,
   preferentially at their cortical area. As UBTF is a useful marker to
   trace rDNA genes, we used these data to improve our previous model of 3D
   organization of active transcribing rDNA gene within fibrillar centers.
   Finally, when rRNA synthesis is inhibited during actinomycin D treatment
   or entry in mitosis, UBTF1 and UBTF2 show a similar distribution along
   extended 3D loop-like structures. Altogether these data suggest new
   roles for UBTF1 and UBTF2 isoforms in the organization of active and
   inactive rDNA genes.},

Abstract = {Topologically associating domains (TADs) are fundamental units of
   three-dimensional (3D) nuclear organization. The regions bordering
   TADs-TAD boundaries-contribute to the regulation of gene expression by
   restricting interactions of cis-regulatory sequences to their target
   genes. TAD and TAD-boundary disruption have been implicated in
   rare-disease pathogenesis; however, we have a limited framework for
   integrating TADs and their variation across cell types into the
   interpretation of common-trait-associated variants. Here, we investigate
   an attribute of 3D genome architecture-the stability of TAD boundaries
   across cell types-and demonstrate its relevance to understanding how
   genetic variation in TADs contributes to complex disease. By
   synthesizing TAD maps across 37 diverse cell types with 41 genome-wide
   association studies (GWASs), we investigate the differences in disease
   association and evolutionary pressure on variation in TADs versus TAD
   boundaries. We demonstrate that genetic variation in TAD boundaries
   contributes more to complex-trait heritability, especially for
   immunologic, hematologic, and metabolic traits. We also show that TAD
   boundaries are more evolutionarily constrained than TADs. Next,
   stratifying boundaries by their stability across cell types, we find
   substantial variation. Compared to boundaries unique to a specific cell
   type, boundaries stable across cell types are further enriched for
   complex-trait heritability, evolutionary constraint, CTCF binding, and
   housekeeping genes. Thus, considering TAD boundary stability across cell
   types provides valuable context for understanding the genome's
   functional landscape and enabling variant interpretation that takes 3D
   structure into account.},

Title = {DNA Replication and Polymer Chain Duplication Reshape the Genome in
   Space and Time},
Journal = {PHYSICAL REVIEW X},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {14},

Abstract = {In eukaryotes, DNA replication constitutes a complex process whereby
   multiple origins are stochastically fired, and from which the
   replication machinery proceeds along chromosomes to achieve the faithful
   synthesis of two identical copies of the genome during the S phase of
   the cell cycle. Experimental evidence shows a functional correlation
   between the dynamics of replication and the spatial organization of the
   genome inside cell nuclei, suggesting that the process of replicating
   DNA may impact chromosome folding. However, the theoretical and
   mechanistic bases of such a hypothesis remain elusive. To address that
   question, we propose a quantitative, minimal framework that integrates
   the dynamics of replication along a polymer chain by accounting
   explicitly for the progression of the replication machinery and the
   resulting formation of sister chromatids. By systematically
   characterizing the 3D structural consequences of replication, and of
   possible interactions between active replication machineries, we show
   that the formation of transient loops may potentially impact chromosome
   organization across multiple temporal and spatial scales, from the level
   of individual origins to that of the global polymer chain. Comparison
   with available microscopy and chromosome conformation capture data in
   yeast suggests that a replicationdependent loop extrusion process may be
   acting in vivo, and may shape chromosomes as loose polymer bottle
   brushes during the S phase. Lastly, we explore the postreplication
   relative organization of sister chromatids and demonstrate the emergence
   of catenations and intertwined structures, which are regulated by the
   density of fired origins.},

Abstract = {Complex architectural rearrangements are associated to the control of
   the HoxD genes in different cell types; yet, how they are implemented in
   single cells remains unknown. By use of polymer models, we dissect the
   locus 3D structure at the single DNA molecule level in mouse embryonic
   stem and cortical neuronal cells, as the HoxD cluster changes from a
   poised to a silent state. Our model describes published Hi-C, 3-way 4C,
   and FISH data with high accuracy and is validated against independent 4C
   data on the Nsi-SB 0.5-Mb duplication and on triple contacts. It reveals
   the mode of action of compartmentalization on the regulation of the HoxD
   genes that have gene- and cell-type-specific multi-way interactions with
   their regulatory elements and high cell-to-cell variability. It shows
   that TADs and higher-order 3D structures, such as metaTADs, associate
   with distinct combinations of epigenetic factors, including but not
   limited to CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) and histone marks.},

Pages = {2125-2135},

Abstract = {We investigate the three-dimensional (3D) conformations of the
   alpha-globin locus at the single-allele level in murine embryonic stem
   cells (ESCs) and erythroid cells, combining polymer physics models and
   high-resolution Capture-C data. Model predictions are validated against
   independent fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) data measuring
   pairwise distances, and Tri-C data identifying three-way contacts. The
   architecture is rearranged during the transition from ESCs to erythroid
   cells, associated with the activation of the globin genes. We find that
   in ESCs, the spatial organization conforms to a highly intermingled 3D
   structure involving non-specific contacts, whereas in erythroid cells
   the alpha-globin genes and their enhancers form a self-contained domain,
   arranged in a folded hairpin conformation, separated from intermingling
   flanking regions by a thermodynamic mechanism of micro-phase separation.
   The flanking regions are rich in convergent CTCF sites, which only
   marginally participate in the erythroid-specific gene-enhancer contacts,
   suggesting that beyond the interaction of CTCF sites, multiple molecular
   mechanisms cooperate to form an interacting domain.},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Extensive 3D folding is required to package a genome into the tiny
   nuclear space, and this packaging must be compatible with proper gene
   expression. Thus, in the well-hierarchized nucleus, chromosomes occupy
   discrete territories and adopt specific 3D organizational structures
   that facilitate interactions between regulatory elements for gene
   expression. The mammalian X chromosome exemplifies this
   structure-function relationship. Recent studies have shown that, upon
   X-chromosome inactivation, active and inactive X chromosomes localize to
   different subnuclear positions and adopt distinct chromosomal
   architectures that reflect their activity states. Here, we review the
   roles of long non-coding RNAs, chromosomal organizational structures and
   the subnuclear localization of chromosomes as they relate to X-linked
   gene expression.},

Title = {Lamin C is required to establish genome organization after mitosis},
Journal = {GENOME BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {22},
Number = {1},
Month = {NOV 15},
Abstract = {Background The dynamic 3D organization of the genome is central to gene
   regulation and development. The nuclear lamina influences genome
   organization through the tethering of lamina-associated domains (LADs)
   to the nuclear periphery. Evidence suggests that lamins A and C are the
   predominant lamins involved in the peripheral association of LADs,
   potentially serving different roles. Results Here, we examine chromosome
   architecture in mouse cells in which lamin A or lamin C are
   downregulated. We find that lamin C, and not lamin A, is required for
   the 3D organization of LADs and overall chromosome organization.
   Striking differences in localization are present as cells exit mitosis
   and persist through early G1 and are linked to differential
   phosphorylation. Whereas lamin A associates with the nascent nuclear
   envelope (NE) during telophase, lamin C remains in the interior,
   surrounding globular LAD aggregates enriched on euchromatic regions.
   Lamin C association with the NE is delayed until several hours into G1
   and correlates temporally and spatially with the post-mitotic NE
   association of LADs. Post-mitotic LAD association with the NE, and
   global 3D genome organization, is perturbed only in cells depleted of
   lamin C, and not lamin A. Conclusions Lamin C regulates LAD dynamics
   during exit from mitosis and is a key regulator of genome organization
   in mammalian cells. This reveals an unexpectedly central role for lamin
   C in genome organization, including inter-chromosomal LAD-LAD
   segregation and LAD scaffolding at the NE, raising intriguing questions
   about the individual and overlapping roles of lamin A/C in cellular
   function and disease.},

Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {9},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY 12},
Abstract = {Recent advances demonstrate that epigenome changes can also cause
   phenotypic diversity and can be heritable across generations, indicating
   that they may play an important role in evolutionary processes. In this
   study, we analyzed the chromosomal distribution of several histone
   modifications in five elite maize cultivars (B73, Mo17, Chang7-2,
   Zheng58, ZD958) and their two wild relatives (Zea mays L. ssp.
   parviglumis and Zea nicaraguensis) using a three-dimensional (3D)
   epigenome karyotyping approach by combining immunostaining and 3D
   reconstruction with deconvolution techniques. The distribution of these
   histone modifications along chromosomes demonstrated that the histone
   modification patterns are conserved at the chromosomal level and have
   not changed significantly following domestication. The comparison of
   histone modification patterns between metaphase chromosomes and
   interphase nuclei showed that some of the histone modifications were
   retained as the cell progressed from interphase into metaphase, although
   remodelling existed. This study will increase comprehension of the
   function of epigenetic modifications in the structure and evolution of
   the maize genome.},

Title = {Essential Role of Syntaxin-Binding Protein-1 in the Regulation of
   Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Secretion},
Journal = {ENDOCRINOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {161},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Circadian secretion of the incretin, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1),
   correlates with expression of the core clock gene, Bmail1, in the
   intestinal L-cell. Several SNARE proteins known to be circadian in
   pancreatic alpha- and beta-cells are also necessary for GLP-1 secretion.
   However, the role of the accessory SNARE, Syntaxin binding protein-1
   (Stxbp1; also known as Munc18-1) in the L-cell is unknown. The aim of
   this study was to determine whether Stxbp1 is under circadian regulation
   in the L-cell and its role in the control of GLP-1 secretion. Stxbp1 was
   highly-enriched in L-cells, and STXBP1 was expressed in a subpopulation
   of L-cells in mouse and human intestinal sections. Stxbp1 transcripts
   and protein displayed circadian patterns in mGLUTag L-cells line, while
   chromatin-immunoprecipitation revealed increased interaction between
   BMAL1 and Stxbp1 at the peak time-point of the circadian pattern. STXBP1
   recruitment to the cytosol and plasma membrane within 30 minutes of
   L-cell stimulation was also observed at this time-point. Loss of Stxbp1
   in vitro and in vivo led to reduced stimulated GLP-1 secretion at the
   peak time-point of circadian release, and impaired GLP-1 secretion ex
   vivo. In conclusion, Stxbp1 is a circadian regulated exocytotic protein
   in the intestinal L-cell that is an essential regulatory component of
   GLP-1 secretion.},

   chromosome dynamics and its biological roles},
Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Month = {FEB 9},
Abstract = {Numerous intra- and inter-chromosomal contacts have been mapped in
   eukaryotic genomes, but it remains challenging to link these 3D
   structures to their regulatory functions. To establish the causal
   relationships between chromosome conformation and genome functions, we
   develop a method, Chemically Induced Chromosomal Interaction (CICI), to
   selectively perturb the chromosome conformation at targeted loci. Using
   this method, long-distance chromosomal interactions can be induced
   dynamically between intra- or inter-chromosomal loci pairs, including
   the ones with very low Hi-C contact frequencies. Measurement of CICI
   formation time allows us to probe chromosome encounter dynamics between
   different loci pairs across the cell cycle. We also conduct two
   functional tests of CICI. We perturb the chromosome conformation near a
   DNA double-strand break and observe altered donor preference in
   homologous recombination; we force interactions between early and
   late-firing DNA replication origins and find no significant changes in
   replication timing. These results suggest that chromosome conformation
   plays a deterministic role in homology-directed DNA repair, but not in
   the establishment of replication timing. Overall, our study demonstrates
   that CICI is a powerful tool to study chromosome dynamics and 3D genome
   function.
   Methods to selectively manipulate specific long-distance chromosomal
   interactions are limited. Here the authors develop a method called
   Chemically Induced Chromosomal Interaction (CICI) to engineer
   interactions and demonstrate that 3D conformation plays a causal role in
   establishing donor DNA preference during DNA repair.},

Title = {Investigation of nanoscale structural alterations of cell nucleus as an
   early sign of cancer},
Journal = {BMC BIOPHYSICS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {7},
Month = {FEB 10},
Abstract = {Background: The cell and tissue structural properties assessed with a
   conventional bright-field light microscope play a key role in cancer
   diagnosis, but they sometimes have limited accuracy in detecting
   early-stage cancers or predicting future risk of cancer progression for
   individual patients (i.e., prognosis) if no frank cancer is found. The
   recent development in optical microscopy techniques now permit the
   nanoscale structural imaging and quantitative structural analysis of
   tissue and cells, which offers a new opportunity to investigate the
   structural properties of cell and tissue below 200-250 nm as an early
   sign of carcinogenesis, prior to the presence of microscale
   morphological abnormalities. Identification of nanoscale structural
   signatures is significant for earlier and more accurate cancer detection
   and prognosis.
   Results: Our group has recently developed two simple spectral-domain
   optical microscopy techniques for assessing 3D nanoscale structural
   alterations -spectral-encoding of spatial frequency microscopy and
   spatial-domain low-coherence quantitative phase microscopy. These two
   techniques use the scattered light from biological cells and tissue and
   share a common experimental approach of assessing the Fourier space by
   various wavelengths to quantify the 3D structural information of the
   scattering object at the nanoscale sensitivity with a simple
   reflectance-mode light microscopy setup without the need for high-NA
   optics. This review paper discusses the physical principles and
   validation of these two techniques to interrogate nanoscale structural
   properties, as well as the use of these methods to probe nanoscale
   nuclear architectural alterations during carcinogenesis in cancer cell
   lines and well-annotated human tissue during carcinogenesis.
   Conclusions: The analysis of nanoscale structural characteristics has
   shown promise in detecting cancer before the microscopically visible
   changes become evident and proof-of-concept studies have shown its

Title = {The nuts and bolts of the endogenous spliceosome},
Journal = {WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-RNA},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {8},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN-FEB},
Abstract = {The complex life of pre-mRNA from transcription to the production of
   mRNA that can be exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm to encode
   for proteins entails intricate coordination and regulation of a network
   of processing events. Coordination is required between transcription and
   splicing and between several processing events including 5 and 3 end
   processing, splicing, alternative splicing and editing that are major
   contributors to the diversity of the human proteome, and occur within a
   huge and dynamic macromolecular machinethe endogenous spliceosome.
   Detailed mechanistic insight of the splicing reaction was gained from
   studies of the in vitro spliceosome assembled on a single intron.
   Because most pre-mRNAs are multiintronic that undergo alternative
   splicing, the in vivo splicing machine requires additional elements to
   those of the in vitro machine, to account for all these diverse
   functions. Information about the endogenous spliceosome is emerging from
   imaging studies in intact and live cells that support the
   cotranscriptional commitment to splicing model and provide information
   about splicing kinetics in vivo. Another source comes from studies of
   the in vivo assembled spliceosome, isolated from cell nuclei under
   native conditionsthe supraspliceosomethat individually package pre-mRNA
   transcripts of different sizes and number of introns into complexes of a
   unique structure, indicating their universal nature. Recent years have
   portrayed new players affecting alternative splicing and novel
   connections between splicing, transcription and chromatin. The challenge
   ahead is to elucidate the structure and function of the endogenous
   spliceosome and decipher the regulation and coordination of its network
   of processing activities. (C) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Abstract = {Current techniques for chromosome analysis need to be improved for
   rapid, economical identification of complex chromosomal defects by
   sensitive and selective visualisation. In this paper, we present a
   straightforward method for characterising unstained human metaphase
   chromosomes. Backscatter imaging in a dark-field setup combined with
   visible and short near-infrared spectroscopy is used to monitor
   morphological differences in the distribution of the chromosomal fine
   structure in human metaphase chromosomes. The reasons for the scattering
   centres in the fine structure are explained. Changes in the scattering
   centres during preparation of the metaphases are discussed. FDTD
   simulations are presented to substantiate the experimental findings. We
   show that local scattering features consisting of underlying spectral
   modulations of higher frequencies associated with a high variety of
   densely packed chromatin can be represented by their scatter profiles
   even on a sub-microscopic level. The result is independent of the
   chromosome preparation and structure size. This analytical method
   constitutes a rapid, cost-effective and label-free cytogenetic technique
   which can be used in a standard light microscope.},

Abstract = {Inhibitor of growth protein 4 (ING4) belongs to the ING family of tumour
   suppressors and is involved in chromatin remodelling, in growth arrest
   and, in cooperation with p53, in senescence and apoptosis. Whereas the
   structure and histone H3-binding properties of the C-terminal PHD
   domains of the ING proteins are known, no structural information is
   available for the N-terminal domains. This domain contains a putative
   oligomerization site rich in helical structure in the ING2-5 members of
   the family. The N-terminal domain of ING4 was overexpressed in
   Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity. Crystallization
   experiments yielded crystals that were suitable for high-resolution
   X-ray diffraction analysis. The crystals belonged to the orthorhombic
   space group C222, with unit-cell parameters a = 129.7, b = 188.3, c =
   62.7 angstrom. The self-rotation function and the Matthews coefficient
   suggested the presence of three protein dimers per asymmetric unit. The
   crystals diffracted to a resolution of 2.3 angstrom using synchrotron
   radiation at the Swiss Light Source (SLS) and the European Synchrotron
   Radiation Facility (ESRF).},

Volume = {78},

Abstract = {DNA single-strand breaks (SSBs) are among the most common lesions in the
   genome, arising spontaneously and as intermediates of many DNA
   transactions. Nevertheless, in contrast to double-strand breaks (DSBs),
   their distribution in the genome has hardly been addressed in a
   meaningful way. We now present a technique based on genome-wide ligation
   of 3'-OH ends followed by sequencing (GLOE-Seq) and an associated
   computational pipeline designed for capturing SSBs but versatile enough
   to be applied to any lesion convertible into a free 3'-OH terminus. We
   demonstrate its applicability to mapping of Okazaki fragments without
   prior size selection and provide insight into the relative contributions
   of DNA ligase 1 and ligase 3 to Okazaki fragment maturation in human
   cells. In addition, our analysis reveals biases and asymmetries in the
   distribution of spontaneous SSBs in yeast and human chromatin, distinct
   from the patterns of DSBs.},

Title = {Measuring the reproducibility and quality of Hi-C data},
Journal = {GENOME BIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {20},
Month = {MAR 19},
Abstract = {BackgroundHi-C is currently the most widely used assay to investigate
   the 3D organization of the genome and to study its role in gene
   regulation, DNA replication, and disease. However, Hi-C experiments are
   costly to perform and involve multiple complex experimental steps; thus,
   accurate methods for measuring the quality and reproducibility of Hi-C
   data are essential to determine whether the output should be used
   further in a study.ResultsUsing real and simulated data, we profile the
   performance of several recently proposed methods for assessing
   reproducibility of population Hi-C data, including HiCRep, GenomeDISCO,
   HiC-Spector, and QuASAR-Rep. By explicitly controlling noise and
   sparsity through simulations, we demonstrate the deficiencies of
   performing simple correlation analysis on pairs of matrices, and we show
   that methods developed specifically for Hi-C data produce better
   measures of reproducibility. We also show how to use established
   measures, such as the ratio of intra- to interchromosomal interactions,
   and novel ones, such as QuASAR-QC, to identify low-quality
   experiments.ConclusionsIn this work, we assess reproducibility and
   quality measures by varying sequencing depth, resolution and noise
   levels in Hi-C data from 13 cell lines, with two biological replicates
   each, as well as 176 simulated matrices. Through this extensive
   validation and benchmarking of Hi-C data, we describe best practices for
   reproducibility and quality assessment of Hi-C experiments. We make all
   software publicly available at
   http://github.com/kundajelab/3DChromatin\_ReplicateQC to facilitate
   adoption in the community.},

Title = {Visualization of the three-dimensional structure of the human centromere
   in mitotic chromosomes by superresolution microscopy},
Journal = {MOLECULAR BIOLOGY OF THE CELL},

Abstract = {The human centromere comprises large arrays of repetitive a-satellite
   DNA at the primary constriction of mitotic chromosomes. In addition,
   centromeres are epigenetically specified by the centromere-specific
   histone H3 variant CENP-A that supports kinetochore assembly to enable
   chromosome segregation. Because CENP-A is bound to only a fraction of
   the a-satellite elements within the megabase-sized centromere DNA,
   correlating the three-dimensional (3D) organization of a-satellite DNA
   and CENP-A remains elusive. To visualize centromere organization within
   a single chromatid, we used a combination of the centromere chromosome
   orientation fluorescence in situ hybridization (Cen-CO-FISH) technique
   together with structured illumination microscopy. Cen-CO-FISH allows the
   differential labeling of the sister chromatids without the denaturation
   step used in conventional FISH that may affect DNA structure. Our data
   indicate that a-satellite DNA is arranged in a ring-like organization
   within prometaphase chromosomes, in the presence or absence of spindle's
   microtubules. Using expansion microscopy, we found that CENP-A
   organization within mitotic chromo-somes follows a rounded pattern
   similar to that of a-satellite DNA, often visible as a ring thicker at
   the outer surface oriented toward the kinetochore-microtubule interface.
   Collec-tively, our data provide a 3D reconstruction of a-satellite DNA
   along with CENP-A clusters that outlines the overall architecture of the
   mitotic centromere.},

Abstract = {Structural analyses of organelles and localization of proteins in their
   confines are essential to investigate inner workings of eukaryotic
   cells. Electron tomography (ET) is a three-dimensional electron
   microscopy method with which we can extract sliced views of organelles
   from any direction and quantify their structural parameters at
   nanometer-level resolution. This advanced electron microscopy tool is
   suited for characterization of convoluted membrane compartments and of
   cellular constituents of dimensions smaller than 100 nm. ET studies of
   plant cells fixed by rapid freezing have expanded our understanding of
   the biogenesis and functions of plant organelles. Here we describe how
   the molecular imaging capacity of correlative light and electron
   microscopy can be integrated with ET in studies of plant organelles.},

Title = {Cooperation between a hierarchical set of recruitment sites targets the
   X chromosome for dosage compensation},
Journal = {ELIFE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {6},
Month = {MAY 31},
Abstract = {In many organisms, it remains unclear how X chromosomes are specified
   for dosage compensation, since DNA sequence motifs shown to be important
   for dosage compensation complex (DCC) recruitment are themselves not
   X-specific. Here, we addressed this problem in C. elegans. We found that
   the DCC recruiter, SDC-2, is required to maintain open chromatin at a
   small number of primary DCC recruitment sites, whose sequence and
   genomic context are X-specific. Along the X, primary recruitment sites
   are interspersed with secondary sites, whose function is X-dependent. A
   secondary site can ectopically recruit the DCC when additional
   recruitment sites are inserted either in tandem or at a distance (>30
   kb). Deletion of a recruitment site on the X results in reduced DCC
   binding across several megabases surrounded by topologically associating
   domain (TAD) boundaries. Our work elucidates that hierarchy and
   long-distance cooperativity between gene-regulatory elements target a
   single chromosome for regulation.},

Title = {A new model of sperm nuclear architecture following assessment of the
   organization of centromeres and telomeres in three-dimensions},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {7},
Month = {JAN 31},
Abstract = {The organization of chromosomes in sperm nuclei has been proposed to
   possess a unique ``hairpin-loop{''} arrangement, which is hypothesized
   to aid in the ordered exodus of the paternal genome following
   fertilization. This study simultaneously assessed the 3D and 2D radial
   and longitudinal organization of telomeres, centromeres, and
   investigated whether chromosomes formed the same centromere clusters in
   sperm cells. Reproducible radial and longitudinal non-random
   organization was observed for all investigated loci using both 3D and 2D
   approaches in multiple subjects. We report novel findings, with
   telomeres and centromeres being localized throughout the nucleus but
   demonstrating roughly a 1: 1 distribution in the nuclear periphery and
   the intermediate regions with <15\% occupying the nuclear interior.
   Telomeres and centromeres were observed to aggregate in sperm nuclei,
   forming an average of 20 and 7 clusters, respectively. Reproducible
   longitudinal organization demonstrated preferential localization of
   telomeres and centromeres in the mid region of the sperm cell.
   Preliminary evidence is also provided to support the hypothesis that
   specific chromosomes preferentially form the same centromere clusters.
   The more segmental distribution of telomeres and centromeres as
   described in this study could more readily accommodate and facilitate
   the sequential exodus of paternal chromosomes following fertilization.},

Title = {Optimizing multiple sequence alignments using a genetic algorithm based
   on three objectives: structural information, non-gaps percentage and
   totally conserved columns},
Journal = {BIOINFORMATICS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {29},
Number = {17},
Pages = {2112-2121},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {Motivation: Multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) are widely used
   approaches in bioinformatics to carry out other tasks such as structure
   predictions, biological function analyses or phylogenetic modeling.
   However, current tools usually provide partially optimal alignments, as
   each one is focused on specific biological features. Thus, the same set
   of sequences can produce different alignments, above all when sequences
   are less similar. Consequently, researchers and biologists do not agree
   about which is the most suitable way to evaluate MSAs. Recent
   evaluations tend to use more complex scores including further biological
   features. Among them, 3D structures are increasingly being used to
   evaluate alignments. Because structures are more conserved in proteins
   than sequences, scores with structural information are better suited to
   evaluate more distant relationships between sequences.
   Results: The proposed multiobjective algorithm, based on the
   non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm, aims to jointly optimize three
   objectives: STRIKE score, non-gaps percentage and totally conserved
   columns. It was significantly assessed on the BAliBASE benchmark
   according to the Kruskal-Wallis test (P < 0.01). This algorithm also
   outperforms other aligners, such as ClustalW, Multiple Sequence
   Alignment Genetic Algorithm (MSA-GA), PRRP, DIALIGN, Hidden Markov Model
   Training (HMMT), Pattern-Induced Multi-sequence Alignment (PIMA),
   MULTIALIGN, Sequence Alignment Genetic Algorithm (SAGA), PILEUP, Rubber
   Band Technique Genetic Algorithm (RBT-GA) and Vertical Decomposition
   Genetic Algorithm (VDGA), according to the Wilcoxon signed-rank test (P
   < 0.05), whereas it shows results not significantly different to
   3D-COFFEE (P > 0.05) with the advantage of being able to use less
   structures. Structural information is included within the objective
   function to evaluate more accurately the obtained alignments.},

Title = {CTCF and R-loops are boundaries of cohesin-mediated DNA looping},
Journal = {MOLECULAR CELL},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {83},
Number = {16},
Pages = {2856+},
Month = {AUG 17},
Abstract = {Cohesin and CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) are key regulatory proteins of
   three-dimensional (3D) genome or-ganization. Cohesin extrudes DNA loops
   that are anchored by CTCF in a polar orientation. Here, we present
   direct evidence that CTCF binding polarity controls cohesin-mediated DNA
   looping. Using single-molecule imaging, we demonstrate that a critical
   N-terminal motif of CTCF blocks cohesin translocation and DNA loop-ing.
   The cryo-EM structure of the cohesin-CTCF complex reveals that this CTCF
   motif ahead of zinc fingers can only reach its binding site on the STAG1
   cohesin subunit when the N terminus of CTCF faces cohesin. Remarkably, a
   C-terminally oriented CTCF accelerates DNA compaction by cohesin.
   DNA-bound Cas9 and Cas12a ribonucleoproteins are also polar cohesin
   barriers, indicating that stalling may be intrinsic to co-hesin itself.
   Finally, we show that RNA-DNA hybrids (R-loops) block cohesin-mediated
   DNA compaction in vitro and are enriched with cohesin subunits in vivo,
   likely forming TAD boundaries.},

Title = {CD146<SUP>+</SUP> Human Umbilical Cord Perivascular Cells Maintain

Abstract = {The human umbilical cord perivascular cells (HUCPVCs) have been
   considered as an alternative source of mesenchymal progenitors for cell
   based regenerative medicine. However, the biological properties of these
   cells remain to be well characterized. In the present study, HUCPVCs
   were isolated and sorted by CD146(+) pericyte marker. The purified
   CD146(+) HUCPVCs were induced to differentiate efficiently into
   osteoblast, chondrocyte and adipocyte lineages in vitro. Six weeks
   following subcutaneous transplantation of CD146(+)
   HUCPVCs-Gelfoam-alginate 3D complexes in severe combined
   immunodeficiency (SCID) mice, newly formed bone matrix with embedded
   osteocytes of donor origin was observed. The functional engraftment of
   CD146(+) HUCPVCs in the new bone regenerates was further confirmed in a
   critical-sized bone defect model in SCID mice. Hypoxic conditions
   suppressed osteogenic differentiation while increased cell proliferation
   and colony-forming efficiency of CD146(+) HUCPVCs as compared to that
   under normoxic conditions. Re-oxygenation restored the
   multi-differentiation potential of the CD146(+) HUCPVCs. Western blot
   analysis revealed an upregulation of HIF-1 alpha, HIF-2 alpha, and OCT-4
   protein expression in CD146(+) HUCPVCs under hypoxia, while there was no
   remarkable change in SOX2 and NANOG expression. The gene expression
   profiles of stem cell transcription factors between cells treated by
   normoxia and hypoxic conditions were compared by PCR array analysis.
   Intriguingly, PPAR-gamma was dramatically downregulated (20-fold) in
   mRNA expression under hypoxia, and was revealed to possess a putative
   binding site in the Hif-2 alpha gene promoter region. Chromatin
   immunoprecipitation assays confirmed the binding of PPAR-gamma protein
   to the Hif-2 alpha promoter and the binding was suppressed by hypoxia
   treatment. Luciferase reporter assay showed that the Hif-2 alpha
   promoter activity was suppressed by PPAR expression. Thus, PPAR-gamma
   may involve in the regulation of HIF-2 alpha for stemness maintenance
   and promoting the expansion of CD146(+) HUCPVCs in response to hypoxia.
   CD146(+) HUCPVCs may serve as a potential autologous cell source for
   bone regeneration.},

Title = {Genome scans of facial features in East Africans and cross-population
   comparisons reveal novel associations},
Journal = {PLOS GENETICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {17},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Author summary Genetic factors play an important role in shaping human
   facial features. Over the last decade, studies have identified numerous
   genes associated with various facial traits. The vast majority of these
   studies have focused on European or Asian populations, while African
   populations have been underrepresented. Increasing the diversity of
   these analyses can reveal novel associations and cross-population
   analyses can help deepen our understanding of known genetic
   associations. We therefore performed a genome scan of 3D facial features
   in African children from Tanzania and then compared our results to
   Europeans. We found 20 regions of the genome associated with facial
   shape in Tanzanian children, 10 of which were also present in Europeans,
   indicating evidence for a partly shared genetic basis for human facial
   shape across populations. In addition, about half of the genetic
   associations observed in Tanzanians were not present in Europeans, and
   some of the shared signals differed between populations in the specific
   genetic variants associated or specific facial traits affected. These
   results shed light on the shared and population-specific genetic
   contributors to normal-range facial variation.
   Facial morphology is highly variable, both within and among human
   populations, and a sizable portion of this variation is attributable to
   genetics. Previous genome scans have revealed more than 100 genetic loci
   associated with different aspects of normal-range facial variation. Most
   of these loci have been detected in Europeans, with few studies focusing
   on other ancestral groups. Consequently, the degree to which facial
   traits share a common genetic basis across diverse sets of humans
   remains largely unknown. We therefore investigated the genetic basis of
   facial morphology in an East African cohort. We applied an open-ended
   data-driven phenotyping approach to a sample of 2,595 3D facial images
   collected on Tanzanian children. This approach segments the face into
   hierarchically arranged, multivariate features that capture the shape
   variation after adjusting for age, sex, height, weight, facial size and
   population stratification. Genome scans of these multivariate shape
   phenotypes revealed significant (p < 2.5 x 10(-8)) signals at 20 loci,
   which were enriched for active chromatin elements in human cranial
   neural crest cells and embryonic craniofacial tissue, consistent with an
   early developmental origin of the facial variation. Two of these
   associations were in highly conserved regions showing
   craniofacial-specific enhancer activity during embryological development
   (5q31.1 and 12q21.31). Six of the 20 loci surpassed a stricter threshold
   accounting for multiple phenotypes with study-wide significance (p <
   6.25 x 10(-10)). Cross-population comparisons indicated 10 association
   signals were shared with Europeans (seven sharing the same associated
   SNP), and facilitated fine-mapping of causal variants at previously
   reported loci. Taken together, these results may point to both shared
   and population-specific components to the genetic architecture of facial
   variation.},

Title = {Fractal and Knot-Free Chromosomes Facilitate Nucleoplasmic Transport},
Journal = {PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {128},
Number = {3},
Month = {JAN 21},
Abstract = {Chromosomes in the nucleus assemble into hierarchies of 3D domains that,
   during interphase, share essential features with a knot-free condensed
   polymer known as the fractal globule (FG). The FG-like chromosome likely
   affects macromolecular transport, yet its characteristics remain poorly
   understood. Using computer simulations and scaling analysis, we show
   that the 3D folding and macromolecular size of the chromosomes determine
   their transport characteristics. Large-scale subdiffusion occurs at a
   critical particle size where the network of accessible volumes is
   critically connected. Condensed chromosomes have connectivity networks
   akin to simple Bernoulli bond percolation clusters, regardless of the
   polymer models. However, even if the network structures are similar, the
   tracer's walk dimension varies. It turns out that the walk dimension
   depends on the network topology of the accessible volume and dynamic
   heterogeneity of the tracer's hopping rate. We find that the FG
   structure has a smaller walk dimension than other random geometries,
   suggesting that the FG-like chromosome structure accelerates
   macromolecular diffusion and target-search.},

Title = {Tri-directional anaphases as a novel chromosome segregation defect in
   human oocytes},

Abstract = {STUDY QUESTION: What are the chromosome segregation errors in human
   oocyte meiosis-I that may underlie oocyte aneuploidy?
   SUMMARY ANSWER: Multiple modes of chromosome segregation error were
   observed, including tri-directional anaphases, which we attribute to
   loss of bipolar spindle structure at anaphase-I.
   WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Oocyte aneuploidy is common and associated with
   infertility, but mechanistic information on the chromosome segregation
   errors underlying these defects is scarce. Lagging chromosomes were
   recently reported as a possible mechanism by which segregation errors
   occur.
   STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: Long-term confocal imaging of chromosome
   dynamics in 50 human oocytes collected between January 2015 and May
   2016.
   PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Germinal vesicle (GV) stage
   oocytes were collected from women undergoing intracytoplasmic sperm
   injection cycles and also CD1 mice. Oocytes were microinjected with
   complementary RNAs to label chromosomes, and in a subset of oocytes, the
   meiotic spindle. Oocytes were imaged live through meiosis-I using
   confocal microscopy. 3D image reconstruction was used to classify
   chromosome segregation phenotypes at anaphase-I. Segregation phenotypes
   were related to spindle dynamics and cell cycle timings.
   MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Most (87\%) mouse oocytes
   segregated chromosomes with no obvious defects. We found that 20\% of
   human oocytes segregated chromosomes bi-directionally with no lagging
   chromosomes. The rest were categorised as bidirectional anaphase with
   lagging chromosomes (20\%), bi-directional anaphase with chromatin mass
   separation (34\%) or tri-directional anaphase (26\%). Segregation errors
   correlated with chromosome misalignment prior to anaphase. Spindles were
   tripolar when tri-directional anaphases occurred. Anaphase phenotypes
   did not correlate with meiosis-I duration (P = 0.73).
   LARGE SCALE DATA: Not applicable.
   LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Oocytes were recovered at GV stage
   after gonadotrophin-stimulation, and the usual oocyte quality caveats
   apply. Whilst the possibility that imaging may affect oocyte physiology
   cannot be formally excluded, detailed controls and justifications are
   presented.
   WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: This is one of the first reports of
   live imaging of chromosome dynamics in human oocytes, introducing
   tri-directional anaphases as a novel potential mechanism for oocyte
   aneuploidy.},

Title = {Shikonin blocks CAF-induced TNBC metastasis by suppressing mitochondrial

   degradation of PGC-1α},

Abstract = {BackgroundTriple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is characterized by its
   high metastatic potential, which results in poor patient survival.
   Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are crucial in facilitating TNBC
   metastasis via induction of mitochondrial biogenesis. However, how to
   inhibit CAF-conferred mitochondrial biogenesis is still needed to
   explore.MethodsWe investigated metastasis using wound healing and cell
   invasion assays, 3D-culture, anoikis detection, and NOD/SCID mice.
   Mitochondrial biogenesis was detected by MitoTracker green FM staining,
   quantification of mitochondrial DNA levels, and blue-native
   polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The expression, transcription, and
   phosphorylation of peroxisome-proliferator activated receptor
   coactivator 1 alpha (PGC-1 alpha) were detected by western blotting,
   chromatin immunoprecipitation, dual-luciferase reporter assay,
   quantitative polymerase chain reaction, immunoprecipitation, and liquid
   chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The prognostic role of PGC-1
   alpha in TNBC was evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier plotter database and
   clinical breast cancer tissue samples.ResultsWe demonstrated that PGC-1
   alpha indicated lymph node metastasis, tumor thrombus formation, and
   poor survival in TNBC patients, and it was induced by CAFs, which
   functioned as an inducer of mitochondrial biogenesis and metastasis in
   TNBC. Shikonin impeded the CAF-induced PGC-1 alpha expression, nuclear
   localization, and interaction with estrogen-related receptor alpha (ERR
   alpha), thereby inhibiting PGC-1 alpha/ERR alpha-targeted mitochondrial
   genes. Mechanistically, the downregulation of PGC-1 alpha was mediated
   by synthase kinase 3 beta-induced phosphorylation of PGC-1 alpha at
   Thr295, which associated with neural precursor cell expressed
   developmentally downregulated 4e1 recognition and subsequent degradation
   by ubiquitin proteolysis. Mutation of PGC-1 alpha at Thr295 negated the
   suppressive effects of shikonin on CAF-stimulated TNBC mitochondrial
   biogenesis and metastasis in vitro and in vivo.ConclusionsOur findings
   indicate that PGC-1 alpha is a viable target for blocking TNBC
   metastasis by disrupting mitochondrial biogenesis, and that shikonin
   merits potential for treatment of TNBC metastasis as an inhibitor of
   mitochondrial biogenesis through targeting PGC-1 alpha.},

Title = {Tumor-secreted PAI-1 promotes breast cancer metastasis via the induction
   of adipocyte-derived collagen remodeling},
Journal = {CELL COMMUNICATION AND SIGNALING},
Year = {2019},

Abstract = {BackgroundBreast cancer cells recruit surrounding stromal cells, such as
   cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), to remodel collagen and promote
   tumor metastasis. Adipocytes are the most abundant stromal partners in
   breast tissue, local invasion of breast cancer leads to the proximity of
   cancer cells and adipocytes, which respond to generate cancer-associated
   adipocytes (CAAs). These cells exhibit enhanced secretion of
   extracellular matrix related proteins, including collagens. However, the
   role of adipocyte-derived collagen on breast cancer progression still
   remains unclear.MethodsAdipocytes were cocultured with breast cancer
   cells for 3D collagen invasion and collagen organization exploration.
   Breast cancer cells and adipose tissue co- implanted mouse model,
   clinical breast cancer samples analysis were used to study the crosstalk
   between adipose and breast cancer cells in vivo. A combination of
   proteomics, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, loss of function assay,
   qPCR, western blot, database analysis and chromatin immunoprecipitation
   assays were performed to study the mechanism mediated the activation of
   PLOD2 in adipocytes.ResultsIt was found that CAAs remodeled collagen
   alignment during crosstalk with breast cancer cells in vitro and in
   vivo, which further promoted breast cancer metastasis. Tumor-derived
   PAI-1 was required to activate the expression of the intracellular
   enzyme procollagen-lysine, 2-oxoglutarate 5-dioxygenase 2 (PLOD2) in
   CAAs. Pharmacologic blockade of PAI-1 or PLOD2 disrupted the collagen
   reorganization in CAAs. Mechanistically, it was observed that PI3K/AKT
   pathway was activated in adipocytes upon co-culturing with breast cancer
   cells or treatment with recombinant PAI-1, which could promote the
   translocation of transcription factor FOXP1 into the nucleus and further
   enhanced the promoter activity of PLOD2 in CAAs. In addition, collagen
   reorganization at the tumor-adipose periphery, as well as the positive
   relevance between PAI-1 and PLOD2 in invasive breast carcinoma were
   confirmed in clinical specimens of breast cancer.ConclusionIn summary,
   our findings revealed a new stromal collagen network that favors tumor
   invasion and metastasis establish between breast cancer cells and
   surrounding adipocytes at the tumor invasive front, and identified PLOD2
   as a therapeutic target for metastatic breast cancer treatment.},

Title = {Induction of the Erythroid Differentiation of K562 Cells Is Coupled with
   Changes in the Inter-Chromosomal Contacts of rDNA Clusters},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {24},
Number = {12},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The expression of clusters of rDNA genes influences pluripotency;
   however, the underlying mechanisms are not yet known. These clusters
   shape inter-chromosomal contacts with numerous genes controlling
   differentiation in human and Drosophila cells. This suggests a possible
   role of these contacts in the formation of 3D chromosomal structures and
   the regulation of gene expression in development. However, it has not
   yet been demonstrated whether inter-chromosomal rDNA contacts are
   changed during differentiation. In this study, we used human leukemia
   K562 cells and induced their erythroid differentiation in order to study
   both the changes in rDNA contacts and the expression of genes. We
   observed that approximately 200 sets of rDNA-contacting genes are
   co-expressed in different combinations in both untreated and
   differentiated K562 cells. rDNA contacts are changed during
   differentiation and coupled with the upregulation of genes whose
   products are mainly located in the nucleus and are highly associated
   with DNA- and RNA-binding, along with the downregulation of genes whose
   products mainly reside in the cytoplasm or intra- or extracellular
   vesicles. The most downregulated gene is ID3, which is known as an
   inhibitor of differentiation, and thus should be switched off to allow
   for differentiation. Our data suggest that the differentiation of K562
   cells leads to alterations in the inter-chromosomal contacts of rDNA
   clusters and 3D structures in particular chromosomal regions as well as
   to changes in the expression of genes located in the corresponding
   chromosomal domains. We conclude that approximately half of the
   rDNA-contacting genes are co-expressed in human cells and that rDNA
   clusters are involved in the global regulation of gene expression.},

Title = {Characterizing the variation in chromosome structure ensembles in the
   context of the nuclear microenvironment},
Journal = {PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {18},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Inside the nucleus, chromosomes are subjected to direct physical
   interaction between different components, active forces, and thermal
   noise, leading to the formation of an ensemble of three-dimensional
   structures. However, it is still not well understood to what extent and
   how the structural ensemble varies from one chromosome region or
   cell-type to another. We designed a statistical analysis technique and
   applied it to single-cell chromosome imaging data to reveal the
   heterogeneity of individual chromosome structures. By analyzing the
   resulting structural landscape, we find that the largest dynamic
   variation is the overall radius of gyration of the chromatin region,
   followed by domain reorganization within the region. By comparing
   different human cell-lines and experimental perturbation data using this
   statistical analysis technique and a network-based similarity
   quantification approach, we identify both cell-type and
   condition-specific features of the structural landscapes. We identify a
   relationship between epigenetic state and the properties of chromosome
   structure fluctuation and validate this relationship through polymer
   simulations. Overall, our study suggests that the types of variation in
   a chromosome structure ensemble are cell-type as well as region-specific
   and can be attributed to constraints placed on the structure by factors
   such as variation in epigenetic state.
   Author summaryRecent work has revealed principles of how chromosomes are
   folded and structured inside the human nucleus. It is now even possible
   to microscopically trace the path of chromosomes in 3D in individual
   cells. With this data, we can start to examine how much variation exists
   in chromosome structure and what biological factors may restrict or
   enhance this variation. Are chromosomes stuck in just a few possible
   positions or do they move around more freely, sampling many
   configurations? Here, we use a mathematical approach to compare
   chromosome structure variation in different cell types, at different
   locations along the genome, and when key structural proteins are
   removed. Through these comparisons and dynamic simulations of chromosome
   behavior, we identify factors that may constrain or promote variation in
   chromosome structure.},

Title = {Effect of an Antioxidant Supplement Combination on Boar Sperm},
Journal = {ANIMALS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {10},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Simple Summary Boar spermatozoa can be exposed to many harmful factors.
   The low antioxidant capacity of spermatozoa makes them susceptible to
   reactive oxygen species. The protection of spermatozoa from these
   harmful effects lies in the seminal plasma, which is enriched by
   antioxidant enzymes. This study aimed to measure the antioxidant status
   of boar seminal plasma, and to determine spermatozoa DNA status, and the
   total number of motile spermatozoa after the concurrent joint
   application in the boars' diet of two commercial products with
   antioxidative potential. The study was conducted on a commercial pig
   farm located in Serbia. Thirty Duroc or Landrace breed boars were
   randomly selected for this study. The experimental group was fed a
   compound feed with added organic selenium and Oxynat 3D. The antioxidant
   status parameters of boar seminal plasma were evaluated using a
   biochemical analyzer and commercial Randox kits. The sperm chromatin
   structure assay (SCSA) using flow cytometry (FC) provided information
   about spermatozoa's DNA status. Additionally, the total number of motile
   spermatozoa and spermatozoa kinematic parameters were measured using the
   computer-assisted sperm analysis (CASA) system. The aim of this study
   was to improve the parameters of semen by combining two preparations
   that have a potential antioxidant effect, but also to establish the
   level of various antioxidant enzymes in native sperm. There was no
   statistically significant difference in total antioxidant capacity and
   glutathione peroxidase activity in the seminal plasma obtained from the
   experimental and control groups of boars. Regarding the superoxide
   dismutase activity, the research results showed a difference in the
   control group compared to the experimental one. Moreover, spermatozoa
   DNA fragmentation and the total number of motile spermatozoa showed
   statistically significant lower and higher values, respectively, in
   experimental compared to the control groups. The combination of these
   two preparations shows significantly enhanced vital parameters of semen.
   To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first in which the
   ejaculate parameters were examined after the application of a
   combination of these two antioxidant supplements.},

Abstract = {Structural alterations of chromosomes are often found in wheat-rye
   hybrids. In the majority of cases modifications are observed for rye
   chromosomes, yet chromosome aberration cases are described for wheat,
   including the progeny of Triticum aestivum disomic and monosomic
   addition lines. Since wheat-rye substitution and translocation lines are
   the source of rye chromatin in wheat breeding programs, the information
   on possible chromosome changes in the genomes of introgressive forms is
   important. Chromosome behavior in F-1 meiosis and chromosomal
   composition of F-2 karyotypes for double monosomics 1Rv-1A were studied
   by applying C-banding, genomic in situ hybridisation (GISH) using rye
   genomic DNA, and sequential in situ hybridization using repetitive
   sequences pAs1, pSc119.2 and centromere specific pAet-06 as probes. The
   double monosomics 1Rv-1A were obtained by crossing of disomic
   substitution line with chromosome 1A replaced by Secale cereale 1Rv in
   the bread wheat Saratovskaya 29 (S29) background with S29. The results
   indicated a high frequency of bipolar chromosome 1Rv orientation, as
   compared to 1A, at metaphase I (MI) (58.6 and 34.7 \% of meiocytes,
   respectively), and, at anaphase I (AI), chromatid segregation of 1Rv
   compared to 1A (70.53 and 32.14 \% of meiocytes, respectively). In few
   cases desynapsis of wheat homologues was observed, at AI, the
   chromosomes randomly distributed between the poles or underwent
   chromatid segregation. At AI, the two wheat homologues separated onto
   sister chromatids in 10.89 \% of cells.The plants F2 karyotypes were
   marked with aneuploidy not only of chromosomes 1A and 1Rv, but also of
   1D, 2D, 3D, 3B, 3A, 4A, 6D, 6B, 6A, and 7D. Structural changes were
   observed for the chromosomes of the first homoeologous group (1Rv, 1A,
   1D, 1B), as well as for 2B, 5D, 6B, and 7B. The chromosomes 1Rv and 6B
   often demonstrated aberrations. The types of aberrations were
   centromeric break, deletions of various sizes, and a changed repeat
   pSc119.2 localization pattern.},

Title = {A phenotypic screening approach to target p60AmotL2-expressing invasive
   cancer cells},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL \& CLINICAL CANCER RESEARCH},
Year = {2024},

Abstract = {Background Tumor cells have the ability to invade and form small
   clusters that protrude into adjacent tissues, a phenomenon that is
   frequently observed at the periphery of a tumor as it expands into
   healthy tissues. The presence of these clusters is linked to poor
   prognosis and has proven challenging to treat using conventional
   therapies. We previously reported that p60AmotL2 expression is localized
   to invasive colon and breast cancer cells. In vitro, p60AmotL2 promotes
   epithelial cell invasion by negatively impacting
   E-cadherin/AmotL2-related mechanotransduction.Methods Using epithelial
   cells transfected with inducible p60AmotL2, we employed a phenotypic
   drug screening approach to find compounds that specifically target
   invasive cells. The phenotypic screen was performed by treating cells
   for 72 h with a library of compounds with known antitumor activities in
   a dose-dependent manner. After assessing cell viability using
   CellTiter-Glo, drug sensitivity scores for each compound were
   calculated. Candidate hit compounds with a higher drug sensitivity score
   for p60AmotL2-expressing cells were then validated on lung and colon
   cell models, both in 2D and in 3D, and on colon cancer patient-derived
   organoids. Nascent RNA sequencing was performed after BET inhibition to
   analyse BET-dependent pathways in p60AmotL2-expressing cells.Results We
   identified 60 compounds that selectively targeted p60AmotL2-expressing
   cells. Intriguingly, these compounds were classified into two major
   categories: Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) inhibitors and
   Bromodomain and Extra-Terminal motif (BET) inhibitors. The latter
   consistently demonstrated antitumor activity in human cancer cell
   models, as well as in organoids derived from colon cancer patients. BET
   inhibition led to a shift towards the upregulation of pro-apoptotic
   pathways specifically in p60AmotL2-expressing cells.Conclusions BET
   inhibitors specifically target p60AmotL2-expressing invasive cancer
   cells, likely by exploiting differences in chromatin accessibility,
   leading to cell death. Additionally, our findings support the use of
   this phenotypic strategy to discover novel compounds that can exploit
   vulnerabilities and specifically target invasive cancer cells.},

Title = {Enhancers on the edge - how the nuclear envelope controls gene
   regulatory elements},
Journal = {CURRENT OPINION IN GENETICS \& DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {87},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Precise temporal and sequential control of gene expression during
   development and in response to environmental stimuli requires tight
   regulation of the physical contact between gene regulatory elements and
   promoters. Current models describing how the genome folds in 3D space to
   establish these interactions often ignore the role of the most stable
   structural nuclear feature - the nuclear envelope. While contributions
   of 3D folding within/between topologically associated domains (TADs)
   have been extensively described, mechanical contributions from the
   nuclear envelope can impact enhancer-promoter interactions both directly
   and indirectly through influencing intra/inter-TAD interactions.
   Importantly, these nuclear envelope contributions clearly link this
   mechanism to development and, when defective, to human disease. Here, we
   discuss evidence for nuclear envelope regulation of tissue-specific
   enhancer-promoter pairings, potential mechanisms for this regulation,
   exciting recent findings that other regulatory elements such as
   microRNAs and long noncoding RNAs are under nuclear envelope regulation,
   the possible involvement of condensates, and how disruption of this
   regulation can lead to disease.},

Abstract = {All organisms need to ensure that no DNA segments are rereplicated in a
   single cell cycle. Eukaryotes achieve this through a process called
   origin licensing, which involves tight spatiotemporal control of the
   assembly of prereplicative complexes (pre-RCs) onto chromatin. Cdt1 is a
   key component and crucial regulator of pre-RC assembly. In higher
   eukaryotes, timely inhibition of Cdt1 by Geminin is essential to prevent
   DNA rereplication. Here, we address the mechanism of DNA licensing
   inhibition by Geminin, by combining X-ray crystallography, small-angle
   X-ray scattering, and functional studies in Xenopus and mammalian cells.
   Our findings show that the Cdt1: Geminin complex can exist in two
   distinct forms, a ``permissive{''} heterotrimer and an ``inhibitory{''}
   heterohexamer. Specific Cdt1 residues, buried in the heterohexamer, are
   important for licensing. We postulate that the transition between the
   heterotrimer and the heterohexamer represents a molecular switch between
   licensing-competent and licensing-defective states.},

Abstract = {Although our understanding of the involvement of heterochromatin
   architectural factors in shaping nuclear organization is improving,
   there is still ongoing debate regarding the role of active genes in this
   process. In this study, we utilize publicly-available Micro-C data from
   mouse embryonic stem cells to investigate the relationship between gene
   transcription and 3D gene folding. Our analysis uncovers a nonmonotonic
   - globally positive - correlation between intragenic contact density and
   Pol II occupancy, independent of cohesin-based loop extrusion. Through
   the development of a biophysical model integrating the role of
   transcription dynamics within a polymer model of chromosome
   organization, we demonstrate that Pol II-mediated attractive
   interactions with limited valency between transcribed regions yield
   quantitative predictions consistent with chromosome-conformation-capture
   and live-imaging experiments. Our work provides compelling evidence that
   transcriptional activity shapes the 4D genome through Pol II-mediated
   micro-compartmentalization.
   Here, the authors explore gene transcription's impact on 3D gene
   folding. Combining experimental data analysis and biophysical modeling,
   they suggest Pol II-mediated interactions shapes intra-gene condensation
   and inter-gene contacts and impacts gene dynamics.},

   Differentiation and Reprogramming},
Journal = {ADVANCED SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {7},
Number = {20},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {As an essential and fundamental process of life, cell development
   involves large-scale reorganization of the 3D genome architecture, which
   forms the basis of gene regulation. Here, a landscape-switching model is
   developed to explore the microscopic chromosomal structural origin of
   embryonic stem cell (ESC) differentiation and somatic cell
   reprogramming. It is shown that chromosome structure exhibits
   significant compartment-switching in the unit of topologically
   associating domain. It is found that the chromosome during
   differentiation undergoes monotonic compaction with spatial
   repositioning of active and inactive chromosomal loci toward the
   chromosome surface and interior, respectively. In contrast, an
   overexpanded chromosome, which exhibits universal localization of loci
   at the chromosomal surface with erasing the structural characteristics
   formed in the somatic cells, is observed during reprogramming. An early
   distinct differentiation pathway from the ESC to the terminally
   differentiated cell, giving rise to early bifurcation on the Waddington
   landscape for the ESC differentiation is suggested. The theoretical
   model herein including the non-equilibrium effects, draws a picture of
   the highly irreversible cell differentiation and reprogramming
   processes, in line with the experiments. The predictions provide a
   physical understanding of cell differentiation and reprogramming from
   the chromosomal structural and dynamical perspective and can be tested
   by future experiments.},

Title = {Follow-Up Study Confirms the Presence of Gastric Cancer DNA Methylation
   Hallmarks in High-Risk Precursor Lesions},

Abstract = {Simple Summary
   Intestinal metaplasia confers an increased risk of progression to
   gastric cancer. However, some intestinal metaplasia patients do not
   develop cancer. The development of robust molecular biomarkers to
   stratify patients with advanced gastric precursor lesions at risk of
   cancer progression will contribute to guiding programs for prevention.
   Starting from a genome-wide methylation study, we have simplified the
   detection method regarding candidate-methylation tests to improve their
   applicability in the clinical environment. We identified CpG methylation
   at the ZNF793 and RPRM promoters as a common event in intestinal
   metaplasia and intestinal forms of gastric cancer. Furthermore, we also
   showed that Helicobacter pylori infection influences DNA methylation in
   early precursor lesions but not in intestinal metaplasia, suggesting
   that therapeutic strategies to prevent epigenome reprogramming toward a
   cancer signature need to be adopted early in the precursor cascade.
   To adopt prevention strategies in gastric cancer, it is imperative to
   develop robust biomarkers with acceptable costs and feasibility in
   clinical practice to stratified populations according to risk scores.
   With this aim, we applied an unbiased genome-wide CpG methylation
   approach to a discovery cohort composed of gastric cancer (n = 24), and
   non-malignant precursor lesions (n = 64). Then, candidate-methylation
   approaches were performed in a validation cohort of precursor lesions
   obtained from an observational longitudinal study (n = 264), with a
   12-year follow-up to identify repression or progression cases. H. pylori
   stratification and histology were considered to determine their
   influence on the methylation dynamics. As a result, we ascertained that
   intestinal metaplasia partially recapitulates patterns of aberrant
   methylation of intestinal type of gastric cancer, independently of the
   H. pylori status. Two epigenetically regulated genes in cancer, RPRM and
   ZNF793, consistently showed increased methylation in intestinal
   metaplasia with respect to earlier precursor lesions. In summary, our
   result supports the need to investigate the practical utilities of the
   quantification of DNA methylation in candidate genes as a marker for
   disease progression. In addition, the H. pylori-dependent methylation in
   intestinal metaplasia suggests that pharmacological treatments aimed at
   H. pylori eradication in the late stages of precursor lesions do not
   prevent epigenome reprogramming toward a cancer signature.},

Title = {Structure of an atypical Tudor domain in the <i>Drosophila</i>
   Polycomblike protein},

Abstract = {Post-translational modifications of histone tails are among the most
   prominent epigenetic marks and play a critical role in transcriptional
   control at the level of chromatin. The Polycomblike (Pcl) protein is
   part of a histone methyltransferase complex (Pcl-PRC2) responsible for
   high levels of histone H3 K27 trimethylation. Studies in Drosophila
   larvae suggest that Pcl is required for anchoring Pcl-PRC2 at target
   genes, but how this is achieved is unknown. Pcl comprises a Tudor domain
   and two PHD fingers. These domains are known to recognize methylated
   lysine or arginine residues and could contribute to targeting of
   Pcl-PRC2. Here, we report an NMR structure of the Tudor domain from
   Drosophila Pcl (Pcl-Tudor) and binding studies with putative ligands.
   Pcl-Tudor contains an atypical, incomplete aromatic cage that does not
   interact with known Tudor domain ligands, such as methylated lysines or
   arginines. Interestingly, human Pcl orthologs exhibit a complete
   aromatic cage, suggesting that they may recognize methylated lysines.
   Structural comparison with other Tudor domains suggests that Pcl-Tudor
   may engage in intra- or intermolecular interactions through an exposed
   hydrophobic surface patch.},

Journal = {MOLECULAR BIOLOGY},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {42},
Number = {3},
Pages = {449-455},

Abstract = {The nucleolar organization in ciliate Didinium nasutum somatic
   interphase nuclei was studied using serial ultrathin sections and
   compared for various physiological states of the cell, namely, fed
   ciliates, starved ciliates, and dormant cysts. It has been shown that
   the interphase nucleoli are large structures with a complex
   architecture: the fibrillar component forms an intricate network in the
   macronucleus space, while the granular component is located inside this
   network. The structures looking as individual nucleoli in single
   sections are actually parts of branched nucleolar networks. The
   intricate nucleolar networks do not disintegrate after a 30-h
   starvation; however, the granular component becomes denser and develops
   numerous cavities filled with fine fibrils of a nonribonucleoprotein
   nature. In fed D. nasutum, the fibrillar structures on the periphery of
   nucleoli contain numerous pores (virtually absent in starved cell
   nucleoli), which can potentially serve for transporting newly
   synthesized rRNP. Branched nucleolar networks are undetectable in cysts.
   Their nucleoli are individual structures consisting mainly of the
   fibrogranular component.},

Journal = {PATHOLOGY \& ONCOLOGY RESEARCH},

Month = {NOV 8},
Abstract = {The quantitative detection of radiation caused DNA double-strand breaks
   (DSB) by immunostained gamma-H2AX foci using direct stochastic optical
   reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM) provides a deeper insight into the
   DNA repair process at nanoscale in a time-dependent manner. Glioblastoma
   (U251) cells were irradiated with 250 keV X-ray at 0, 2, 5, 8 Gy dose
   levels. Cell cycle phase distribution and apoptosis of U251 cells upon
   irradiation was assayed by flow cytometry. We studied the density,
   topology and volume of the gamma-H2AX foci with 3D confocal microscopy
   and the dSTORM superresolution method. A pronounced increase in
   gamma-H2AX foci and cluster density was detected by 3D confocal
   microscopy after 2 Gy, at 30 min postirradiation, but both returned to
   the control level at 24 h. Meanwhile, at 24 h a considerable amount of
   residual foci could be measured from 5 Gy, which returned to the normal
   level 48 h later. The dSTORM based gamma-H2AX analysis revealed that the
   micron-sized gamma-H2AX foci are composed of distinct smaller units with
   a few tens of nanometers. The density of these clusters, the epitope
   number and the dynamics of gamma-H2AX foci loss could be analyzed. Our
   findings suggest a discrete level of repair enzyme capacity and the
   restart of the repair process for the residual DSBs, even beyond 24 h.
   The dSTORM superresolution technique provides a higher precision over 3D
   confocal microscopy to study radiation induced gamma-H2AX foci and
   molecular rearrangements during the repair process, opening a novel
   perspective for radiation research.},

Abstract = {Spatial genome organization within the nucleus influences major
   biological processes and is impacted by the configuration of linear
   chromosomes. Here, we applied 3D spatial statistics and modeling on high
   -resolution telomere and centromere 3D -structured illumination
   microscopy images in cancer cells. We found a multi -scale organization
   of telomeres that dynamically evolved from a mixed clustered -and
   -regular distribution in early G1 to a purely regular distribution as
   cells progressed through the cell cycle. In parallel, our analysis
   revealed two pools of peripheral and internal telomeres, the proportions
   of which were inverted during the cell cycle. We then conducted a
   targeted screen using MadID to identify the molecular pathways driving
   or maintaining telomere anchoring to the nuclear envelope observed in
   early G1. Lamina -associated polypeptide (LAP) proteins were found
   transiently localized to telomeres in anaphase, a stage where LAP2 a
   initiates the reformation of the nuclear envelope, and impacted telomere
   redistribution in the next interphase together with their partner
   barrier-to-autointegration factor (BAF).},

Abstract = {Extracellular matrix signals from the microenvironment regulate gene
   expression patterns and cell behavior. Using a combination of
   experiments and geometric models, we demonstrate correlations between
   cell geometry, three-dimensional (3D) organization of chromosome
   territories, and gene expression. Fluorescence in situ hybridization
   experiments showed that micropatterned fibroblasts cultured on
   anisotropic versus isotropic substrates resulted in repositioning of
   specific chromosomes, which contained genes that were differentially
   regulated by cell geometries. Experiments combined with ellipsoid
   packing models revealed that the mechanosensitivity of chromosomes was
   correlated with their orientation in the nucleus. Transcription
   inhibition experiments suggested that the intermingling degree was more
   sensitive to global changes in transcription than to chromosome radial
   positioning and its orientations. These results suggested that cell
   geometry modulated 3D chromosome arrangement, and their neighborhoods
   correlated with gene expression patterns in a predictable manner. This
   is central to understanding geometric control of genetic programs
   involved in cellular homeostasis and the associated diseases.},

Title = {Exploring the Role of Enhancer-Mediated Transcriptional Regulation in
   Precision Biology},

Abstract = {The emergence of precision biology has been driven by the development of
   advanced technologies and techniques in high-resolution biological
   research systems. Enhancer-mediated transcriptional regulation, a
   complex network of gene expression and regulation in eukaryotes, has
   attracted significant attention as a promising avenue for investigating
   the underlying mechanisms of biological processes and diseases. To
   address biological problems with precision, large amounts of data,
   functional information, and research on the mechanisms of action of
   biological molecules is required to address biological problems with
   precision. Enhancers, including typical enhancers and super enhancers,
   play a crucial role in gene expression and regulation within this
   network. The identification and targeting of disease-associated
   enhancers hold the potential to advance precision medicine. In this
   review, we present the concepts, progress, importance, and challenges in
   precision biology, transcription regulation, and enhancers. Furthermore,
   we propose a model of transcriptional regulation for multi-enhancers and
   provide examples of their mechanisms in mammalian cells, thereby
   enhancing our understanding of how enhancers achieve precise regulation
   of gene expression in life processes. Precision biology holds promise in
   providing new tools and platforms for discovering insights into gene
   expression and disease occurrence, ultimately benefiting individuals and
   society as a whole.},

Title = {Structural evidence for elastic tethers connecting separating
   chromosomes in crane-fly spermatocytes},
Journal = {LIFE SCIENCE ALLIANCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {6},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Different types of anaphase bridges are reported to form between
   segregating chromosomes during cell division. Previous studies using
   laser microsurgery suggested that elastic tethers connect the telomeres
   of separating anaphase chromosomes in many animal meiotic and mitotic
   cells. However, structural evidence is lacking for their existence. In
   this study, by correlating live imaging with electron tomography, we
   examined whether visible structures connect separating telomeres in
   meiosis I of crane-fly primary spermatocytes. We found structures
   extending between separating telomeres in all stages of anaphase. The
   structures consist of two components: one is darkly stained, looking
   somewhat like chromatin, whereas the other is more lightly stained,
   appearing filamentous. Although in early anaphase both structures extend
   between telomeres, in later anaphase, the darker structure extends
   shorter distances from the telomeres but the lighter structure still
   extends between the separating telomeres. From these observations, we
   deduced that these structures represent the ``tethers{''} inferred from
   the laser-cutting experiments. Because elastic tethers have been
   detected in a variety of animal cells, they probably are present during
   anaphase in all animal cells.},

Abstract = {The spatial organization of polytene chromosomes and the association of
   their pericentromeric regions in the Drosophila melanogaster nurse cells
   during oogenesis have been examined by 3D-immunofluorescence microscopy.
   All nurse cell chromosomes are shown to contact the nuclear membrane
   with their pericentromeric regions, and the X chromosome additionally
   with its telomeric region. Three morphological types of the associations
   of the nurse cell chromosome pericentromeric regions in the nuclear
   space are observed: (1) the pericentromeric regions of chromosomes 2, 3,
   and 4 contact the nuclear membrane at one pole of the nucleus, while the
   pericentromeric region of the X chromosome does so at the other pole
   (morphotype I); (2) the pericentromeric regions of chromosomes X, 2, and
   3 are separated from each other in the nuclear space and contact the
   nuclear membrane (morphotype II); and (3) the pericentromeric region of
   chromosome 2 contacts the nuclear membrane at one pole of the nucleus,
   while the pericentromeric regions of chromosomes X, 3, and 4 contact the
   membrane at the other pole (morphotype III). The author, therefore,
   proposes that the nurse cell nuclei with morphotype I are prevalent at
   the early stages of oogenesis, while the nurse cell nuclei with
   morphotype III are most abundant at the late stages. The dynamics of
   associations of the pericentromeric chromosome regions in the nuclear
   space of D. melanogaster ovarian nurse cells in the oogenesis
   demonstrated that there may be some functional relationship between the
   3-D organization of the nurse cell chromosomes and the organization of
   the nucleolus.},

Abstract = {The KDM5C gene (also known as JARID1C and SMCX) is located on the X
   chromosome and encodes a ubiquitously expressed 1560-aa protein, which
   plays an important role in lysine methylation (specifically reverses
   tri- and di-methylation of Lys4 of histone H3). Currently, 13 missense
   mutations in KDM5C have been linked to X-linked mental retardation.
   However, the molecular mechanism of disease is currently unknown due to
   the experimental difficulties in expressing such large protein and the
   lack of experimental 3D structure. In this work, we utilize homology
   modeling, docking, and experimental data to predict 3D structures of
   KDM5C domains and their mutual arrangement. The resulting quaternary
   structure includes KDM5C JmjN, ARID, PHD1, JmjC, ZF domains, substrate
   histone peptide, enzymatic cofactors, and DNA. The predicted quaternary
   structure was investigated with molecular dynamic simulation for its
   stability, and further analysis was carried out to identify features
   measured experimentally. The predicted structure of KDM5C was used to
   investigate the effects of disease-causing mutations and it was shown
   that the mutations alter domain stability and inter-domain interactions.
   The structural model reported in this work could prompt experimental
   investigations of KDM5C domain-domain interaction and exploration of
   undiscovered functionalities. Proteins 2016; 84:1797-1809. (c) 2016

Title = {The transcription factors Creb1 and CEBPB regulate Sox9 promoter
   activity in TM4 Sertoli cells},
Journal = {GENE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {873},
Month = {JUL 15},
Abstract = {In Sertoli cells, the Sox9 gene is essential for testicular development
   and normal spermatogenesis. SOX9 is critical for postnatal Sertoli cells
   differentiation and proliferation in the testis. However, the molecular
   mechanisms that specifically regulate its expression are not entirely
   understood. Sox9 expression is regulated by CREB1 and CEBPB in other
   biological contexts such as during chondrogenesis and in rat thyroid
   follicular cells. We hy-pothesized that Sox9 promoter activity is
   regulated by CREB1 and CEBPB in Sertoli cells. Our results show that
   Sox9 expression is dependent on the activation of these transcription
   factors by the cAMP/PKA signaling pathway in TM4 Sertoli cells.
   Chromatin immunoprecipitation and promoter/reporter luciferase assays
   with 5 ` promoter deletions and site-directed mutagenesis demonstrated
   that CREB1 is being recruited to a DNA regu-latory element at-141 bp of
   the Sox9 promoter region. Such regulation is dependent on the cAMP/PKA
   signaling pathway, resulting in phosphorylation of CREB1. Activation of
   Sox9 expression by CEBPB may involve its recruitment to the proximal
   promoter region by protein-protein interaction with CREB1. Thus, we have
   shown that the Sox9 promoter is being regulated by the transcription
   factors CREB1 and CEBPB in TM4 Sertoli cells and involve their
   recruitment to the proximal promoter region.},

Abstract = {Current models for the folding of the human genome see a hierarchy
   stretching down from chromosome territories, through A/B compartments
   and topologically-associating domains (TADs), to contact domains
   stabilized by cohesin and CTCF. However, molecular mechanisms underlying
   this folding, and the way folding affects transcriptional activity,
   remain obscure. Here we review physical principles driving proteins
   bound to long polymers into clusters surrounded by loops, and present a
   parsimonious yet comprehensive model for the way the organization
   determines function. We argue that clusters of active RNA polymerases
   and their transcription factors are major architectural features; then,
   contact domains, TADs and compartments just reflect one or more loops
   and clusters. We suggest tethering a gene close to a cluster containing
   appropriate factors-a transcription factory-increases the firing
   frequency, and offer solutions to many current puzzles concerning the
   actions of enhancers, super-enhancers, boundaries and eQTLs (expression

Title = {SPoRE: a mathematical model to predict double strand breaks and axis
   protein sites in meiosis},
Journal = {BMC BIOINFORMATICS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {15},
Month = {DEC 11},
Abstract = {Background: Meiotic recombination between homologous chromosomes
   provides natural combinations of genetic variations and is a main
   driving force of evolution. It is initiated via programmed DNA
   double-strand breaks (DSB) and involves a specific axial chromosomal
   structure. So far, recombination regions have been mainly determined by
   experiments, both expensive and time-consuming.
   Results: SPoRE is a mathematical model that describes the non-uniform
   localisation of DSB and axis proteins sites, and distinguishes high
   versus low protein density. It is based on a combination of genomic
   signals, based on what is known from wet-lab experiments, whose
   contribution is precisely quantified. It models axis proteins
   accumulation at gene 5'-ends with a discrete approximation of their
   diffusion and convection along genes. It models DSB accumulation at
   approximated gene promoter positions with intergenic region length and
   GC-content. SPoRE can be used for prediction and it is parameterised in
   an obvious way that makes it easy to understand from a biological
   viewpoint.
   Conclusions: When compared to Saccharomyces cerevisiae experimental
   data, SPoRE predicts axis protein and DSB positions with high
   sensitivity and precision, axis protein density with an average local
   correlation r = 0.63 and DSB density with an average local correlation r
   = 0.62. SPoRE outbreaks previous DSB predictors, which are based on
   nucleotide patterning, and it reaches 85\% of success rate in DSB
   prediction compared to 54\% obtained by available tools on a benchmarked
   dataset.},

Abstract = {p300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF) is one among the histone
   acetyltransferase (HAT) family enzymes. It is involved in the regulation
   of transcription by modifying the chromatin structure indirectly through
   the acetylation of histones. It has been emerged as a promising drug
   target for various types of cancer. A four-point pharmacophore with two
   hydrogen bond acceptor, one aromatic ring and one hydrophobic feature,
   was generated for six highly active isothiazolone derivatives as PCAF
   inhibitors in order to elucidate their anticancer activity. The
   generated pharmacophore was used for screening three different databases
   such as Maybridge, Life Chemicals and Chembridge databases. The screened
   compounds were further filtered through docking studies. Then the
   compounds were further carried for ADME prediction. The best three
   compounds BTB09406, F1418-0051 and F1880-1727 were docked to GCN5 to
   explore the dual inhibitory properties. The conformational stability of
   the protein-ligand complexes were analyzed through molecular dynamics
   simulation. Three best compounds were finally went through electronic
   structure analysis using density functional theory (DFT) at
   B3LYP/6-31{*}{*}G level to understand their molecular reactivity. The
   results obtained from this study exploit that the three best compounds
   (BTB09406, F1418-0051 and F1880-1727) were found to have more potent and
   dual inhibitory properties.},

Title = {Top-down and Middle-down Protein Analysis Reveals that Intact and

   Patterns},

Abstract = {Post-translational modifications (PTMs) of histone proteins play a
   fundamental role in regulation of DNA-templated processes. There is also
   growing evidence that proteolytic cleavage of histone N-terminal tails,
   known as histone clipping, influences nucleosome dynamics and functional
   properties. Using top-down and middle-down protein analysis by mass
   spectrometry, we report histone H2B and H3 N-terminal tail clipping in
   human hepatocytes and demonstrate a relationship between clipping and
   co-existing PTMs of histone H3. Histones H2B and H3 undergo proteolytic
   processing in primary human hepatocytes and the hepatocellular carcinoma
   cell line HepG2/C3A when grown in spheroid (3D) culture, but not in a
   flat (2D) culture. Using tandem mass spectrometry we localized four
   different clipping sites in H3 and one clipping site in H2B. We show
   that in spheroid culture clipped H3 proteoforms are mainly represented
   by canonical histone H3, whereas in primary hepatocytes over 90\% of
   clipped H3 correspond to the histone variant H3.3. Comprehensive
   analysis of histone H3 modifications revealed a series of PTMs,
   including K14me1, K27me2/K27me3, and K36me1/me2, which are
   differentially abundant in clipped and intact H3. Analysis of
   co-existing PTMs revealed negative crosstalk between H3K36 methylation
   and H3K23 acetylation in clipped H3. Our data provide the first evidence
   of histone clipping in human hepatocytes and demonstrate that clipped H3
   carry distinct co-existing PTMs different from those in intact H3.},

Abstract = {Isochromosomes are mirror- imaged chromosomes with simultaneous
   duplication and deletion of genetic material which may contain two
   centromeres to create isodicentric chromosomes. Although isochromosomes
   commonly occur in cancer and developmental disorders and promote genome
   instability, mechanisms that prevent isochromosomes are not well
   understood. We show here that the tumor suppressor and methyltransferase
   SETD2 is essential to prevent these errors. Using cellular and
   cytogenetic approaches, we demonstrate that loss of SETD2 or its
   epigenetic mark, histone H3 lysine 36 trimethylation (H3K36me3), results
   in the formation of isochromosomes as well as isodicentric and acentric
   chromosomes. These defects arise during DNA replication and are likely
   due to faulty homologous recombination by RAD52. These data provide a
   mechanism for isochromosome generation and demonstrate that SETD2 and
   H3K36me3 are essential to prevent the formation of this common mutable
   chromatin structure known to initiate a cascade of genomic instability
   in cancer.},

Title = {Three invariant Hi-C interaction patterns: Applications to genome
   assembly},
Journal = {METHODS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {142},
Pages = {89-99},
Month = {JUN 1},
Abstract = {Assembly of reference-quality genomes from next-generation sequencing
   data is a key challenge in genomics. Recently, we and others have shown
   that Hi-C data can be used to address several outstanding challenges in
   the field of genome assembly. This principle has since been developed in
   academia and industry, and has been used in the assembly of several
   major genomes. In this paper, we explore the central principles
   underlying Hi-C-based assembly approaches, by quantitatively defining
   and characterizing three invariant Hi-C interaction patterns on which
   these approaches can build: Intrachromosomal interaction enrichment,
   distance-dependent interaction decay and local interaction smoothness.
   Specifically, we evaluate to what degree each invariant pattern holds on
   a single locus level in different species, cell types and Hi-C map
   resolutions. We find that these patterns are generally consistent across
   species and cell types but are affected by sequencing depth, and that
   matrix balancing improves consistency of loci with all three invariant
   patterns. Finally, we overview current Hi-C-based assembly approaches in
   light of these invariant patterns and demonstrate how local interaction
   smoothness can be used to easily detect scaffolding errors in extremely
   sparse Hi-C maps. We suggest that simultaneously considering all three
   invariant patterns may lead to better Hi-C-based genome assembly
   methods.},

Abstract = {Key message This review compares the molecular mechanisms of stem cell
   control in the shoot apical meristems of mosses and angiosperms and
   reveals the conserved features and evolution of plant stem cells. The
   establishment and maintenance of pluripotent stem cells in the shoot
   apical meristem (SAM) are key developmental processes in land plants
   including the most basal, bryophytes. Bryophytes, such as Physcomitrium
   (Physcomitrella) patens and Marchantia polymorpha, are emerging as
   attractive model species to study the conserved features and
   evolutionary processes in the mechanisms controlling stem cells. Recent
   studies using these model bryophyte species have started to uncover the
   similarities and differences in stem cell regulation between bryophytes
   and angiosperms. In this review, we summarize findings on stem cell
   function and its regulation focusing on different aspects including
   hormonal, genetic, and epigenetic control. Stem cell regulation through
   auxin, cytokinin, CLAVATA3/EMBRYO SURROUNDING REGION-RELATED (CLE)
   signaling and chromatin modification by Polycomb Repressive Complex 2
   (PRC2) and PRC1 is well conserved. Several transcription factors crucial
   for SAM regulation in angiosperms are not involved in the regulation of
   the SAM in mosses, but similarities also exist. These findings provide
   insights into the evolutionary trajectory of the SAM and the fundamental
   mechanisms involved in stem cell regulation that are conserved across
   land plants.},

Title = {Increased enhancer-promoter interactions during developmental enhancer
   activation in mammals},
Journal = {NATURE GENETICS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {56},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Remote enhancers are thought to interact with their target promoters via
   physical proximity, yet the importance of this proximity for enhancer
   function remains unclear. Here we investigate the three-dimensional (3D)
   conformation of enhancers during mammalian development by generating
   high-resolution tissue-resolved contact maps for nearly a thousand
   enhancers with characterized in vivo activities in ten murine embryonic
   tissues. Sixty-one percent of developmental enhancers bypass their
   neighboring genes, which are often marked by promoter CpG methylation.
   The majority of enhancers display tissue-specific 3D conformations, and
   both enhancer-promoter and enhancer-enhancer interactions are moderately
   but consistently increased upon enhancer activation in vivo. Less than
   14\% of enhancer-promoter interactions form stably across tissues;
   however, these invariant interactions form in the absence of the
   enhancer and are likely mediated by adjacent CTCF binding. Our results
   highlight the general importance of enhancer-promoter physical proximity
   for developmental gene activation in mammals.
   A catalog of enhancer-promoter (E-P) interactions across ten mouse
   embryonic tissues, supported by in vivo functional experiments, shows
   that E-P proximity increases upon enhancer activation during
   development.},

Abstract = {The C. elegans germline and somatic gonad are actively developing until
   the animal reaches adulthood, and then continue to undergo striking
   changes as the animal ages. Reported changes include a depletion of
   available sperm, a decrease in oocyte quality up till mid-life, a
   reduction in germline nuclei, a decrease in fertility, and an
   accumulation of DNA in the midbody of aging C. elegans. Here, we have
   focused on the aging gonad in old animals, and show in detail that the
   aging gonad undergoes a massive uterine growth composed of
   endoreduplicating oocytes, yolk, and expanses of chromatin. We use a
   novel series of imaging techniques in combination with histological
   methodology for reconstructing aged worms in 3-dimensions, and show in
   old animals growing masses swelling inside the uterus to occupy most of
   the diameter of the worm. We link this accelerated growth to the
   cep-1/p53 tumor suppressor. Because cep-1 is required for DNA damage
   induced apoptosis, and daf-2 limits longevity, these results suggest a
   role for age-related DNA damage in dysplastic uterine growths, which in
   some respects resemble premalignant changes that can occur in aging
   mammals.},

Title = {Geant4-DNA simulations using complex DNA geometries generated by the
   DnaFabric tool},
Journal = {COMPUTER PHYSICS COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {204},
Pages = {159-169},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Several DNA representations are used to study radio-induced complex DNA
   damages depending on the approach and the required level of granularity.
   Among all approaches, the mechanistic one requires the most resolved DNA
   models that can go down to atomistic DNA descriptions. The complexity of
   such DNA models make them hard to modify and adapt in order to take into
   account different biological conditions. The DnaFabric project was
   started to provide a tool to generate, visualise and modify such complex
   DNA models. In the current version of DnaFabric, the models can be
   exported to the Geant4 code to be used as targets in the Monte Carlo
   simulation. In this work, the project was used to generate two DNA fibre
   models corresponding to two DNA compaction levels representing the
   hetero and the euchromatin. The fibres were imported in a Geant4
   application where computations were performed to estimate the influence
   of the DNA compaction on the amount of calculated DNA damage. The
   relative difference of the DNA damage computed in the two fibres for the
   same number of projectiles was found to be constant and equal to 1.3 for
   the considered primary particles (protons from 300 keV to 50 MeV).
   However, if only the tracks hitting the DNA target are taken into
   account, then the relative difference is more important for low energies
   and decreases to reach zero around 10 MeV. The computations were
   performed with models that contain up to 18,000 DNA nucleotide pairs.
   Nevertheless, DnaFabric will be extended to manipulate multi-scale
   models that go from the molecular to the cellular levels.

   Nature of problem:
   Simulations implying DNA geometrical models often show limitations to
   support the huge number of DNA constituents. In order to allow users to
   build, visualise and perform calculations on detailed DNA models
   including hundreds of thousands of DNA elements, a dedicated framework
   is needed.
   Solution method:
   The DnaFabric library is a framework that allows users to easily build
   their own DNA models, display them and perform calculations. The
   DnaFabric includes: hierarchically organised DNA models (binary
   executable example named ``Fibre{''}), a dedicated 3D render engine, an
   optimised OpenGL interface and some multi-threading facilities.
   Unusual features:
   The DnaFabric uses 3D technologies from the computer graphics world
   allowing the rendering of huge DNA models in real-time.
   Additional comments:
   Three examples are provided in the Examples folder. The ``Basic{''}
   example describes how to set-up a simple DnaFabric user-application. The
   ``Fibre{''} example shows the two DNA fibre models used for the
   calculations in this paper. The ``MovingSpheres{''} example,
   demonstrates how to implement a simulation interacting with the DNA
   geometrical model.
   Running time:
   Once a user application is started, an auto-generated window will show
   the 3D model. The efficiency of the rendering depends highly on the user
   hardware. However, the user can customise each of the rendered elements
   contained in its application to adjust the required computer power. (C)

Abstract = {Telomerase-free cancer cells employ a recombination-based alternative
   lengthening of telomeres (ALT) pathway that depends on ALT-associated
   promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies (APBs), whose function is unclear.
   We find that APBs behave as liquid condensates in response to telomere
   DNA damage, suggesting two potential functions: condensation to enrich
   DNA repair factors and coalescence to cluster telomeres. To test these
   models, we developed a chemically induced dimerization approach to
   induce de novo APB condensation in live cells without DNA damage. We
   show that telomere-binding protein sumoylation nucleates APB
   condensation via interactions between small ubiquitin-like modifier
   (SUMO) and SUMO interaction motif (SIM), and that APB coalescence drives
   telomere clustering. The induced APBs lack DNA repair factors,
   indicating that APB functions in promoting telomere clustering can be
   uncoupled from enriching DNA repair factors. Indeed, telomere clustering
   relies only on liquid properties of the condensate, as an alternative
   condensation chemistry also induces clustering independent of
   sumoylation. Our findings introduce a chemical dimerization approach to
   manipulate phase separation and demonstrate how the material properties
   and chemical composition of APBs independently contribute to ALT,
   suggesting a general framework for how chromatin condensates promote
   cellular functions.},

Abstract = {Although the role of liganded nuclear receptors in mediating
   coactivator/corepressor exchange is well-established, little is known
   about the potential regulation of chromosomal organization in the
   3-dimensional space of the nucleus in achieving integrated
   transcriptional responses to diverse signaling events. Here, we report
   that ligand induces rapid interchromosomal interactions among specific
   subsets of estrogen receptor alpha-bound transcription units, with a
   dramatic reorganization of nuclear territories, which depends on the
   actions of nuclear actin/myosin-I machinery and dynein light chain 1.
   The histone lysine demethylase, LSD1, is required for these
   ligand-induced interactive loci to associate with distinct
   interchromatin granules, long thought to serve as ``storage'' sites for
   the splicing machinery, some critical transcription elongation factors,
   and various chromatin remodeling complexes. We demonstrate that this
   2-step nuclear rearrangement is essential for achieving enhanced,
   coordinated transcription of nuclear receptor target genes.},

Title = {3DFAACTS-SNP: using regulatory T cell-specific epigenomics data to
   uncover candidate mechanisms of type 1 diabetes (T1D) risk},
Journal = {EPIGENETICS \& CHROMATIN},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {15},

Month = {JUN 30},
Abstract = {Background Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have enabled the
   discovery of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are
   significantly associated with many autoimmune diseases including type 1
   diabetes (T1D). However, many of the identified variants lie in
   non-coding regions, limiting the identification of mechanisms that
   contribute to autoimmune disease progression. To address this problem,
   we developed a variant filtering workflow called 3DFAACTS-SNP to link
   genetic variants to target genes in a cell-specific manner. Here, we use
   3DFAACTS-SNP to identify candidate SNPs and target genes associated with
   the loss of immune tolerance in regulatory T cells (Treg) in T1D.
   Results Using 3DFAACTS-SNP, we identified from a list of 1228 previously
   fine-mapped variants, 36 SNPs with plausible Treg-specific mechanisms of
   action. The integration of cell type-specific chromosome conformation
   capture data in 3DFAACTS-SNP identified 266 regulatory regions and 47
   candidate target genes that interact with these variant-containing
   regions in Treg cells. We further demonstrated the utility of the
   workflow by applying it to three other SNP autoimmune datasets,
   identifying 16 Treg-centric candidate variants and 60 interacting genes.
   Finally, we demonstrate the broad utility of 3DFAACTS-SNP for functional
   annotation of all known common (> 10\% allele frequency) variants from
   the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD). We identified 9376 candidate
   variants and 4968 candidate target genes, generating a list of potential
   sites for future T1D or other autoimmune disease research. Conclusions
   We demonstrate that it is possible to further prioritise variants that
   contribute to T1D based on regulatory function, and illustrate the power
   of using cell type-specific multi-omics datasets to determine disease
   mechanisms. Our workflow can be customised to any cell type for which
   the individual datasets for functional annotation have been generated,
   giving broad applicability and utility.},

Abstract = {Complex systems are characterized by dynamical processes spread over
   multiple time and length scales. At a given instant, these systems can
   display spatial heterogeneities in which the local physical and chemical
   properties are nonuniform, depending on the location. They can also
   exhibit dynamical heterogeneities in which the local dynamical
   characteristics vary with time. These types of systems pose unique
   experimental challenges for their characterization and test of
   theoretical ideas. Recently, real-time three-dimensional (3D)
   single-particle tracking spectroscopy has been developed to address
   these kinds of problems. With this approach, in principle, one can
   follow how a system evolves spatially as well as temporally. This
   article attempts to provide an introduction to this promising new
   technique by discussing the aims of studying a complex system and recent
   experimental advances towards this goal.

Title = {KMT2D suppresses Sonic hedgehog-driven medulloblastoma progression and

Journal = {ISCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {26},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT 20},
Abstract = {The major cause of treatment failure and mortality among medulloblastoma
   patients is metastasis intracranially or along the spinal cord. The
   molecular mechanisms driving tumor metastasis in Sonic hedgehog-driven
   medulloblastoma (SHH-MB) patients, however, remain largely unknown. In
   this study we define a tumor suppressive role of KMT2D (MLL2), a gene
   frequently mutated in the most metastatic beta-subtype. Strikingly,
   genetic mouse models of SHH-MB demonstrate that heterozygous loss of
   Kmt2d in conjunction with activation of the SHH pathway causes highly
   penetrant disease with decreased survival, increased hindbrain invasion
   and spinal cord metastasis. Loss of Kmt2d attenuates neural
   differentiation and shifts the transcriptional/chromatin landscape of
   primary and metastatic tumors toward a decrease in differentiation genes
   and tumor suppressors and an increase in genes/pathways implicated in
   advanced stage cancer and metastasis (TGF beta, Notch, Atoh1, Sox2, and
   Myc). Thus, secondary heterozygous KMT2D mutations likely have
   prognostic value for identifying SHH-MB patients prone to develop
   metastasis.},

Volume = {115},

Pages = {367-375},

Abstract = {Interphase chromosomes form distinct spatial domains called chromosome
   territories (CTs). The position of CTs is known not to be at random and
   is related to chromosome size and gene density. To elucidate how CTs are
   arranged in primate proliferating fibroblasts and whether the radial
   position of CTs has been conserved during primate evolution, several
   specific CTs corresponding to conserved chromosomes since the
   Simiiformes (human 6, 12, 13, and 17 homologous CTs) have been studied
   in 3D preserved interphase nuclei from proliferant cells of two New
   World monkey species (Lagothrix lagothricha, Saimiri sciureus) and in
   human by three-dimensional fluorescent in situ hybridization (3D-FISH).
   Our results indicate that both gene-density and chromosome size
   influence chromosome territory arrangement in the nucleus. This
   influence is greater for chromosome-size than for gene-density in the
   three species studied. A comparison of the radial position of a given CT
   and its homolog in the species analyzed suggests similar CT
   distributions for homologous chromosomes. Our statistical analysis using
   the logit model shows that such homologous positionings cannot, however,
   be considered identical.},

Title = {Drug Resistance in Medulloblastoma Is Driven by YB-1, ABCB1 and a
   Seven-Gene Drug Signature},

Abstract = {Simple Summary Medulloblastoma is the most common malignant childhood
   brain tumour. Under standard therapy, relapse occurs in 30\% of patients
   and is almost universally fatal, accounting for 10\% of all childhood
   cancer deaths. A barrier to effective medulloblastoma treatment is
   cellular resistance to standard-of-care therapies. Here, we investigate
   mechanisms surrounding medulloblastoma therapy resistance, both related
   to and independent from oncoprotein YB-1. Accordingly, we reveal roles
   for YB-1 in therapy sensitivity and the regulation of the multi-drug
   resistance gene ABCB1. We also identify functions for YB-1 in cell
   invasion, lipid metabolism and activation of the MYC oncoprotein.
   Importantly, through the generation of cell lines resistant to
   standard-of-care medulloblastoma therapies, we identify a drug-tolerant
   gene expression signature which may represent global, targetable
   mediators of medulloblastoma drug resistance. Together, our findings
   reveal important mechanisms and genes underlying therapy resistance in
   medulloblastoma and provide routes to their intervention. Therapy
   resistance represents an unmet challenge in the treatment of
   medulloblastoma. Accordingly, the identification of targets that mark
   drug-resistant cell populations, or drive the proliferation of resistant
   cells, may improve treatment strategies. To address this, we undertook a
   targeted approach focused on the multi-functional transcription factor
   YB-1. Genetic knockdown of YB-1 in Group 3 medulloblastoma cell lines
   diminished cell invasion in 3D in vitro assays and increased sensitivity
   to standard-of-care chemotherapeutic vincristine and anti-cancer agents
   panobinostat and JQ1. For vincristine, this occurred in part by
   YB-1-mediated transcriptional regulation of multi-drug resistance gene
   ABCB1, as determined by chromatin immunoprecipitation. Whole
   transcriptome sequencing of YB-1 knockdown cells identified a role for
   YB-1 in the regulation of tumourigenic processes, including lipid
   metabolism, cell death and survival and MYC and mTOR pathways. Stable
   cisplatin- and vincristine-tolerant Group 3 and SHH cell lines were
   generated to identify additional mechanisms driving resistance to
   standard-of-care medulloblastoma therapy. Next-generation sequencing
   revealed a vastly different transcriptomic landscape following chronic
   drug exposure, including a drug-tolerant seven-gene expression
   signature, common to all sequenced drug-tolerant cell lines,
   representing therapeutically targetable genes implicated in the
   acquisition of drug tolerance. Our findings provide significant insight
   into mechanisms and genes underlying therapy resistance in
   medulloblastoma.},

Abstract = {During early mammalian female development, one of the two X chromosomes
   becomes inactivated. Although X-chromosome coating by Xist RNA is
   essential for the initiation of X inactivation, little is known about
   how this signal is transformed into transcriptional silencing. Here we
   show that exclusion of RNA Polymerase II and transcription factors from
   the Xist RNA-coated X chromosome represents the earliest event following
   Xist RNA accumulation described so far in differentiating embryonic stem
   (ES) cells. Paradoxically, exclusion of the transcription machinery
   occurs before gene silencing is complete. However, examination of the
   three-dimensional organization of X-linked genes reveals that, when
   transcribed, they are always located at the periphery of, or outside,
   the Xist RNA domain, in contact with the transcription machinery. Upon
   silencing, genes shift to a more internal location, within the Xist RNA
   compartment devoid of transcription factors. Surprisingly, the
   appearance of this compartment is not dependent on the A-repeats of the
   Xist transcript, which are essential for gene silencing. However, the
   A-repeats are required for the relocation of genes into the Xist RNA
   silent domain. We propose that Xist RNA has multiple functions:
   A-repeat-independent creation of a transcriptionally silent nuclear
   compartment; and A-repeat-dependent induction of gene repression, which
   is associated with their translocation into this silent domain.},

Title = {Distinguishing States of Arrest: Genome-Wide Descriptions of Cellular

Series = {Methods in Molecular Biology},

Abstract = {Regenerative potential in adult stem cells is closely associated with
   the establishment of-and exit from-a temporary state of quiescence.
   Emerging evidence not only provides a rationale for the link between
   lineage determination programs and cell cycle regulation but also
   highlights the understanding of quiescence as an actively maintained
   cellular program, encompassing networks and mechanisms beyond mitotic
   inactivity or metabolic restriction. Interrogating the quiescent genome
   and transcriptome using deep-sequencing technologies offers an
   unprecedented view of the global mechanisms governing this reversibly
   arrested cellular state and its importance for cell identity. While many
   efforts have identified and isolated pure target stem cell populations
   from a variety of adult tissues, there is a growing appreciation that
   their isolation from the stem cell niche in vivo leads to activation and
   loss of hallmarks of quiescence. Thus, in vitro models that recapitulate
   the dynamic reversibly arrested stem cell state in culture and lend
   themselves to comparison with the activated or differentiated state are
   useful templates for genome-wide analysis of the quiescence network.
   In this chapter, we describe the methods that can be adopted for whole
   genome epigenomic and transcriptomic analysis of cells derived from one
   such established culture model where mouse myoblasts are triggered to
   enter or exit quiescence as homogeneous populations. The ability to
   synchronize myoblasts in G(0) permits insights into the genome in ``deep
   quiescence.{''} The culture methods for generating large populations of
   quiescent myoblasts in either 2D or 3D culture formats are described in
   detail in a previous chapter in this series (Arora et al. Methods Mol
   Biol 1556: 283-302, 2017). Among the attractive features of this model
   are that genes isolated from quiescent myoblasts in culture mark
   satellite cells in vivo (Sachidanandan et al., J Cell Sci 115:
   2701-2712, 2002) providing a validation of its approximation of the
   molecular state of true stem cells. Here, we provide our working
   protocols for ChIP-seq and RNA-seq analysis, focusing on those
   experimental elements that require standardization for optimal analysis
   of chromatin and RNA from quiescent myoblasts, and permitting useful and
   revealing comparisons with proliferating myoblasts or differentiated
   myotubes.},

Abstract = {Genomic DNA is compacted via chromatin condensation in mammalian cells,
   and transcription of such topologically constrained DNA to messenger RNA
   is under strict spatiotemporal regulation. Nevertheless, control of DNA
   topology has been poorly explored in in vitro transcription and gene
   transfection. Here we report the construction of topologically ordered
   (TO-) prokaryotic genes composed of linear DNA templates appended with a
   T7 promoter sequence with the use of DNA self-assembly. We find that
   TO-DNA maintains the transcription activity whereas the activity is
   critically dependent on the configuration of the T7 promoter in a folded
   DNA nanostructure. By prescribing the position and the intactness of the
   T7 promoter, we can dynamically activate or repress transcription in
   response to specific DNA key strands in a Boolean logic manner.
   Bioorthogonal switchable transcription is realized with the insertion of
   multiple genes in a TO-DNA. Further, implementing TO-DNA in living
   bacteria leads to switchable transcription of fluorescent RNA aptamers
   for light-up cell imaging. Hence, the design of TO-DNAs provides a means
   for shape-dependent gene delivery, enriching the toolbox of genetic
   engineering and synthetic biology.},

Abstract = {Chemical inhibition of chromatin-mediated signaling involved proteins is
   an established strategy to drive expression networks and alter disease
   progression. Protein methyltransferases are among the most studied
   proteins in epigenetics and, in particular, disruptor of telomeric
   silencing 1-like (DOT1L) lysine methyltransferase plays a key role in
   MLL-rearranged acute leukemia Selective inhibition of DOT1L is an
   established attractive strategy to breakdown aberrant H3K79 methylation
   and thus overexpression of leukemia genes, and leukemogenesis. Although
   numerous DOT1L inhibitors have been several structural data published no
   pronounced computational efforts have been yet reported. In these
   studies a first tentative of multi-stage and LB/SB combined approach is
   reported in order to maximize the use of available data. Using
   co-crystallized ligand/DOT1L complexes, predictive 3-D QSAR and COMBINE
   models were built through a python implementation of previously reported
   methodologies. The models, validated by either modeled or experimental
   external test sets, proved to have good predictive abilities. The
   application of these models to an internal library led to the selection
   of two unreported compounds that were found able to inhibit DOT1L at
   micromolar level. To the best of our knowledge this is the first report
   of quantitative LB and SB DOT1L inhibitors models and their application
   to disclose new potential epigenetic modulators.

Title = {The Bivalent Bromodomain Inhibitor MT-1 Inhibits Prostate Cancer Growth},
Journal = {CANCERS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Simple Summary MT-1 decreased cell viability and causes cell cycle
   arrest in G0/G1 phase in castration sensitive and resistant PC cell
   lines in a dose-dependent fashion. The inhibition of c-Myc function by
   MT-1 was molecularly corroborated by de-repression of Protein Kinase D1
   (PrKD) and increased phosphorylation of PrKD substrate proteins:
   threonine 120, serine 11 and serine 216 amino acid residues in \&
   beta;-Catenin, snail, and cell division cycle 25c (CDC25c) proteins
   respectively. This is first pre-clinical study demonstrating potential
   utility of MT-1 in the treatment of PC with c-Myc dysregulation.
   Bromodomains (BD) are epigenetic readers of histone acetylation involved
   in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation of several genes
   including protooncogene cellular myelocytomatosis (c-Myc). c-Myc is
   difficult to target directly by agents due to its disordered alpha
   helical protein structure and predominant nuclear localization. The
   epigenetic targeting of c-Myc by BD inhibitors is an attractive
   therapeutic strategy for prostate cancer (PC) associated with increased
   c-Myc upregulation with advancing disease. MT-1 is a bivalent BD
   inhibitor that is 100-fold more potent than the first-in-class BD
   inhibitor JQ1. MT-1 decreased cell viability and causes cell cycle
   arrest in G0/G1 phase in castration-sensitive and resistant PC cell
   lines in a dose-dependent fashion. The inhibition of c-Myc function by
   MT-1 was molecularly corroborated by the de-repression of Protein Kinase
   D1 (PrKD) and increased phosphorylation of PrKD substrate proteins:
   threonine 120, serine 11, and serine 216 amino acid residues in \&
   beta;-Catenin, snail, and cell division cycle 25c (CDC25c) proteins,
   respectively. The treatment of 3D cell cultures derived from three
   unique clinically annotated heavily pretreated patient-derived PC
   xenografts (PDX) mice models with increasing doses of MT-1 demonstrated
   the lowest IC50 in tumors with c-Myc amplification and clinically
   resistant to Docetaxel, Cabazitaxel, Abiraterone, and Enzalutamide. An
   intraperitoneal injection of either MT-1 or in combination with 3jc48-3,
   an inhibitor of obligate heterodimerization with MYC-associated protein
   X (MAX), in mice implanted with orthotopic PC PDX, decreased tumor
   growth. This is the first pre-clinical study demonstrating potential
   utility of MT-1 in the treatment of PC with c-Myc dysregulation.},

Title = {Class I histone deacetylase inhibitor suppresses vasculogenic mimicry by
   enhancing the expression of tumor suppressor and anti-angiogenesis genes
   in aggressive human TNBC cells},

Abstract = {Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells form angiogenesis-independent
   vessel-like structures to survive, known as vasculogenic mimicry (VM),
   contributing to a poor prognosis for cancer patients. Nuclear localized
   class I histone deacetylases (HDACs) enzymes, particularly HDACs 1, 2, 3
   deacetylate chromatin histones, are overexpressed in cancers and
   epigenetically regulate the expression of genes involved in cancer
   initiation and progression. The specific HDAC inhibitor, entinostat, has
   been shown to attenuate tumor progression and metastasis in TNBC. In
   this study, we hypothesized that entinostat would enhance the expression
   of anti-angiogenic and tumor suppressor genes and would thus suppress VM
   structures in TNBC cells in a 3D Matrigel cell culture preclinical
   model. Our data indicated that invasive triple-negative MDA-MB-231,
   LM2-4 and BT-549 breast cancer cells, but not poorly invasive luminal
   MCF-7 cells, efficiently underwent matrix-associated VM formation.
   Approximately 80\% of TNBC cells with the stem cell phenotype potential
   formed vessel-like structures when mixed with Matrigel and cultured in
   the low attachment tissue culture plate. The molecular mechanisms of VM
   formation are rather complex, while angiogenesis inhibitor genes are
   downregulated and pro-angiogenesis genes are upregulated in VM-forming
   cells. Our data revealed that treatment of the TNBC VM phenotype cells
   with entinostat epigenetically led to the re-expression of the
   anti-angiogenic genes, serpin family F member 1 (SERPINF1) and
   thrombospondin 2 (THBS2), and to that of the tumor suppressor genes,
   phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) and p21, and reduced VM
   structures. We also found that treatment of the TNBC VM phenotype cells
   with entinostat downregulated the expression of vascular endothelial
   growth factor A (VEGF-A), and that of the epithelial-mesenchymal
   transition (EMT)-related genes, Vimentin and beta-catenin. METABIRC and
   TCGA breast cancer cohort mRNA expression data analysis revealed that a
   high expression of the anti-angiogenesis-associated genes, THBS2,
   SERPINF1 and serpin family B member 5 (SERPINB5), and of the tumor
   suppressor gene, PTEN, was associated with a better overall survival
   (OS) of breast cancer patients. Taken together, the findings of this
   study demonstrate that HDACs 1, 2, 3 partly contribute to VM formation
   in TNBC cells; thus, HDACs may be an important therapeutic target for
   TNBC.},

Abstract = {The morphology of the basidial sorus and the cytology of basidial
   development was studied in C. vernoniae. The probasidia, which are cut
   off in short chains by a layer of basal cells, develop directly into
   4-celled basidia. Mycelial cells, haustoria, basal cells, and young
   probasidia are binucleate. Each nucleus possesses a distinct nucleolus,
   well-defined chromatin strands, and a nuclear membrane. Nuclear fusion
   takes place in the young probasidium, bringing 2 hap-loid sets of
   chromosomes into a single fusion nucleus. The phase at the beginning of
   nuclear fusion is called leptotene. This is followed immediately by
   zygotene, during which homologous pairs of chromosomes synapse and the 2
   nucleoli fuse. The nucleoli are brought together during synapsis of the
   pair of nucleolus-organizing chromosomes. Zygotene is followed by a
   phase of elongation of the bivalent chromosomes, which probably
   represents a brief metabolic phase. This is followed by diplotene,
   during which the nucleolus completely degenerates and the chromosomes
   distinctly show their double nature. Diplotene quickly merges into
   diakinesis and the nuclear membrane disappears. The bivalent
   chromosomes, apparently 8 in number, are much shortened and thickened.
   The 8 gemini become rather irregularly arranged on the metaphase
   spindle, which is of intranuclear origin and which has centrosome-like
   polar bodies and astral rays. Homologous chromosomes separate at
   anaphase and 8 are believed to pass to each pole. At telophase, the
   astral rays recurve and appear to take part in the formation of the
   cross wall which separates the 2 daughter nuclei. The 1st meiotic
   division is thus completed. The 2 daughter nuclei quickly enter into the
   2 meiotic division. The spindles are similar in appearance to those of
   the first division, but are smaller. Astral rays probably assist in
   cross wall formation here also. A 4-celled, 4-nucleate basidium is
   produced. The basidium produces 4 basidiospores, in each of which a 3d
   nuclear division occurs before it is discharged. One of the 2 resultant
   nuclei degenerates. The possible phylogenetic significance of certain of
   these developments is discussed. Comparisons are made between the
   nuclear developments in Coleosporium and those of higher organisms.},

Title = {The G Protein Estrogen Receptor (GPER) is involved in the resistance to

Abstract = {Background The cyclin D1-cyclin dependent kinases (CDK)4/6 inhibitor
   palbociclib in combination with endocrine therapy shows remarkable
   efficacy in the management of estrogen receptor (ER)-positive and
   HER2-negative advanced breast cancer (BC). Nevertheless, resistance to
   palbociclib frequently arises, highlighting the need to identify new
   targets toward more comprehensive therapeutic strategies in BC
   patients.Methods BC cell lines resistant to palbociclib were generated
   and used as a model system. Gene silencing techniques and overexpression
   experiments, real-time PCR, immunoblotting and chromatin
   immunoprecipitation studies as well as cell viability, colony and 3D
   spheroid formation assays served to evaluate the involvement of the G
   protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) in the resistance to
   palbociclib in BC cells. Molecular docking simulations were also
   performed to investigate the potential interaction of palbociclib with
   GPER. Furthermore, BC cells co-cultured with cancer-associated
   fibroblasts (CAFs) isolated from mammary carcinoma, were used to
   investigate whether GPER signaling may contribute to functional cell
   interactions within the tumor microenvironment toward palbociclib
   resistance. Finally, by bioinformatics analyses and k-means clustering
   on clinical and expression data of large cohorts of BC patients, the
   clinical significance of novel mediators of palbociclib resistance was
   explored.Results Dissecting the molecular events that characterize
   ER-positive BC cells resistant to palbociclib, the down-regulation of ER
   alpha along with the up-regulation of GPER were found. To evaluate the
   molecular events involved in the up-regulation of GPER, we determined
   that the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) interacts with the
   promoter region of GPER and stimulates its expression toward BC cells
   resistance to palbociclib treatment. Adding further cues to these data,
   we ascertained that palbociclib does induce pro-inflammatory
   transcriptional events via GPER signaling in CAFs. Of note, by
   performing co-culture assays we demonstrated that GPER contributes to
   the reduced sensitivity to palbociclib also facilitating the functional
   interaction between BC cells and main components of the tumor
   microenvironment named CAFs.Conclusions Overall, our results provide
   novel insights on the molecular events through which GPER may contribute
   to palbociclib resistance in BC cells. Additional investigations are
   warranted in order to assess whether targeting the GPER-mediated
   interactions between BC cells and CAFs may be useful in more
   comprehensive therapeutic approaches of BC resistant to palbociclib.},

Title = {A p53-independent role of Mdm2 in estrogen-mediated activation of breast
   cancer cell proliferation},
Journal = {BREAST CANCER RESEARCH},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {Introduction: Estrogen receptor positive breast cancers often have high
   levels of Mdm2. We investigated if estrogen signaling in such breast
   cancers occurred through an Mdm2 mediated pathway with subsequent
   inactivation of p53.
   Methods: We examined the effect of long-term 17 beta-estradiol (E2)
   treatment (five days) on the p53-Mdm2 pathway in estrogen receptor alpha
   (ER alpha) positive breast cancer cell lines that contain wild-type p53
   (MCF-7 and ZR75-1). We assessed the influence of estrogen by examining
   cell proliferation changes, activation of transcription of p53 target
   genes, p53-chromatin interactions and cell cycle profile changes. To
   determine the effects of Mdm2 and p53 knockdown on the estrogen-mediated
   proliferation signals we generated MCF-7 cell lines with inducible shRNA
   for mdm2 or p53 and monitored their influence on estrogen-mediated
   outcomes. To further address the p53-independent effect of Mdm2 in ER
   alpha positive breast cancer we generated cell lines with inducible
   shRNA to mdm2 using the mutant p53 expressing cell line T-47D.
   Results: Estrogen increased the Mdm2 protein level in MCF-7 cells
   without decreasing the p53 protein level. After estrogen treatment of
   MCF-7 cells, down-regulation of basal transcription of p53 target genes
   puma and p21 was observed. Estrogen treatment also down-regulated
   etoposide activated transcription of puma, but not p21. Mdm2 knockdown
   in MCF-7 cells increased p21 mRNA and protein, decreased cell growth in
   3D matrigel and also decreased estrogen-induced cell proliferation in 2D
   culture. In contrast, knockdown of p53 had no effect on estrogen-induced
   cell proliferation. In T-47D cells with mutant p53, the knockdown of
   Mdm2 decreased estrogen-mediated cell proliferation but did not increase
   p21 protein.
   Conclusions: Estrogen-induced breast cancer cell proliferation required
   a p53-independent role of Mdm2. The combined influence of genetic and
   environmental factors on the tumor promoting effects of estrogen
   implicated Mdm2 as a strong contributor to the bypass of cell cycle
   checkpoints. The novel finding that p53 was not the key target of Mdm2
   in the estrogen activation of cell proliferation could have great
   benefit for future Mdm2-targeted breast cancer therapies.},

Abstract = {Monolayers of BHK cells infected with aphthovirus (FMDV) were labeled
   for short times with {[}35S]methionine at 2 hr p.i. and fractionated by
   detergent treatment and low speed centrifugation. Polyacrylamide gel
   analysis showed an asymmetric distribution of the FMDV-induced
   polypeptides among the three different subcellular fractions obtained.
   Polypeptide P88-1, the viral capsid protein precursor, is mainly found
   in the soluble cytoplasmic extract while polypeptides P100-3, P52-2AC,
   P34-2C,  and P14-2A are the major viral components of a detergent
   soluble extract of the crude nuclear pellet. Analysis of the detergent
   resistant fraction (DRF), which is mainly composed of cell nuclear
   chromatin and insoluble cytoskeletal elements, shows a clear enrichment
   in an incompletely characterized polypeptide which is tentatively
   designated P54. Variable amounts of polypeptides P100-3 and those of the
   P72 complex are also detected in this fraction. The preferential
   location of P54 in an  equivalent subcellular fraction obtained by mild
   detergent treatment of infected monolayers in situ, and also in a
   high-salt resistant subfraction of the DRF, strongly suggests a close
   association of this polypeptide with vimentin-actin containing
   components of the cell. Polypeptide P54 is immunoprecipitated by viral
   specific antiserum from convalescent guinea pigs but not by serum
   against FMDV capsid proteins, indicating that it does not share common
   antigenic determinants with polypeptides processed from the viral capsid
   precursors. On the other hand, protease V8 mapping of polypeptides
   P100-3, P54, P88-1, and VP1-3 shows that P54 derived from the 3'' end
   coding region of the viral genome. Further analysis by limited protease
   digestion also demonstrates that P54 has partial overlap with P72-3CD
   while it does not share any common peptide with P56a-3D, indicating that
   P54 contains the sequences coded in the 3ABC region of the FMDV RNA.
   This assumption is reinforced by the basic  behavior shown by P54 in
   two-dimensional gels. The results support the hypothesis of a close
   intracellular interaction of a short-lived polypeptide, containing the
   viral protease and VPg sequences, with the host cytoskeleton, during
   infection of BHK cells with FMDV.},

Title = {Epigenetic Alterations in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer-The Critical
   Role of Extracellular Matrix},
Journal = {CANCERS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {4},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Simple Summary
   Current data suggest that epigenetic alterations are involved in the
   initiation and subclonal evolution of breast cancer. During cancer
   progression, the extracellular matrix undergoes significant structural
   alterations and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition is induced. These
   events among other processes are closely related with the epigenetic
   modifiers. Triple-negative breast cancer is an aggressive molecular
   subgroup characterized by genomic complexity and limited therapeutic
   options. Recent knowledge indicates that matrix alterations in
   triple-negative cancer cells are epigenetically regulated and that
   matrix-associated events collectively increase tumor cell survival and
   resistance to therapy. Thus, approaches for targeting tumor
   microenvironment and epigenetic pathways, alone or in combination,
   represent potential therapeutic strategies. The present article aims to
   highlight the most important epigenetic regulation of extracellular
   matrix alterations in triple-negative breast cancer in an effort to give
   perspectives for future design and implementation of diagnostic and
   therapeutic suggestions.
   Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive subgroup of breast
   cancer characterized by genomic complexity and therapeutic options
   limited to only standard chemotherapy. Although it has been suggested
   that stratifying TNBC patients by pathway-specific molecular alterations
   may predict benefit from specific therapeutic agents, application in
   routine clinical practice has not yet been established. There is a
   growing body of the literature supporting that epigenetic modifications
   comprised by DNA methylation, chromatin remodeling and non-coding RNAs
   play a fundamental role in TNBC pathogenesis. Extracellular matrix (ECM)
   is a highly dynamic 3D network of macromolecules with structural and
   cellular regulatory roles. Alterations in the expression of ECM
   components result in uncontrolled matrix remodeling, thus affecting its
   ability to regulate vital functions of cancer cells, including
   proliferation, migration, adhesion, invasion and
   epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Recent molecular data
   highlight the major role of tumor microenvironment and ECM alterations
   in TNBC and approaches for targeting tumor microenvironment have
   recently been recognized as potential therapeutic strategies. Notably,
   many of the ECM/EMT modifications in cancer are largely driven by
   epigenetic events, highlighting the pleiotropic effects of the
   epigenetic network in TNBC. This article presents and critically
   discusses the current knowledge on the epigenetic alterations correlated
   with TNBC pathogenesis, with emphasis on those associated with ECM/EMT
   modifications, their prognostic and predictive value and their use as
   therapeutic targets.},

Abstract = {With the development of 3C (chromosome conformation capture) and its

   capture) research, the study of the spatial structure of the genomic
   sequence in the nucleus helps researchers understand the functions of
   biological processes such as gene transcription, replication, repair,
   and regulation. In this paper, we first introduce the research
   background and purpose of Hi-C data visualization analysis. After that,
   we discuss the Hi-C data analysis methods from genome 3D structure, A/B
   compartment, TADs (topologically associated domain), and loop detection.
   We also discuss how to apply genome visualization technologies to the
   identification of chromosome feature structures. We continue with a
   review of correlation analysis differences among multi-omics data, and
   how to apply Hi-C and other omics data analysis into cancer and cell
   differentiation research. Finally, we summarize the various problems in
   joint analyses based on Hi-C and other multi-omics data. We believe this
   review can help researchers better understand the progress and
   applications of 3D genome technology. (C) 2021 The Author(s). Published

Abstract = {The actin cytoskeleton is crucial for endocytosis, intracellular
   trafficking, cell shape maintenance and a wide range of other cellular
   functions. Recently introduced cell-permeable fluorescent actin probes,
   such as SiR-actin, suffer from poor membrane permeability and stain some
   cell populations inhomogeneously due to the active efflux by the plasma
   membrane pumps. We analyzed a series of new probes composed of
   jasplakinolide and modified rhodamine fluorophores and found that
   rhodamine positional isomerism has a profound effect on probe
   performance. The probes based on the 6'-carboxy-carbopyronine scaffold
   are considerably less susceptible to efflux and allow efficient staining
   without efflux pump inhibitors. They can be used for 2D and 3D
   fluorescence nanoscopy at high nanomolar concentrations without
   significant cytotoxicity. We show that jasplakinolide-based fluorescent
   probes bind not only to actin filaments, but also to G-actin, which
   enables imaging highly dynamic actin structures. We demonstrate an
   excellent performance of the new probes in multiple organisms and cell
   types: human cell lines, frog erythrocytes, fruit fly tissues and
   primary neurons.},

Abstract = {The advent of super-resolution microscopy allowed for new insights into
   cellular and physiological processes of normal and diseased cells. In
   this study, we report for the first time on the super-resolved DNA
   structure of buccal cells from patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD)
   versus age-and gender-matched healthy, non-caregiver controls. In this
   super-resolution study cohort of 74 participants, buccal cells were
   collected and their spatial DNA organization in the nucleus examined by
   3D Structured Illumination Microscopy (3D-SIM). Quantitation of the
   super-resolution DNA structure revealed that the nuclear
   super-resolution DNA structure of individuals with AD significantly
   differs from that of their controls (p < 0.05) with an overall increase
   in the measured DNA-free/poor spaces. This represents a significant
   increase in the interchromatin compartment. Wealso find that
   theDNAstructure ofADsignificantly differs in mild, moderate, and severe
   disease with respect to the DNA-containing and DNA-free/poor spaces. We
   conclude that whole genome remodeling is a feature of buccal cells in

Abstract = {Heart development is controlled by a complex transcriptional network
   composed of transcription factors and epigenetic regulators. Mutations
   in key developmental transcription factor MESP1 and chromatin factors,
   such as PRC1 and cohesin components, have been found in human congenital
   heart diseases (CHDs), although their functional mechanism during heart
   development remains elusive. Here, we find that MESP1 interacts with
   RING1A/RING1, the core component of PRC1. RING1A depletion impairs human
   cardiomyo-cyte differentiation, and cardiac abnormalities similar to
   those in patients with MESP1 mutations were observed in Ring1A knockout
   mice. Mechanistically, MESP1 associates with RING1A to activate
   cardiogenic genes through promoter-enhancer interactions regulated by
   cohesin and CTCF and histone acetylation mediated by p300. Importantly,
   CHD mutations of MESP1 significantly affect such mechanisms and impair
   target gene activation. Together, our results demonstrate the importance
   of MESP1-RING1A complex in heart development and provide insights into
   the pathogenic mechanisms of CHDs caused by mutations in MESP1, PRC1,
   and cohesin components.},

Title = {Structural homology-based identification of BEN domain proteins in
   Poxviruses},
Journal = {BIOCHEMICAL AND BIOPHYSICAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {712},
Month = {JUN 18},
Abstract = {BEND family transcription factors directly interact with DNA through BEN
   domains and have been found across metazoan species. Interestingly,
   certain insect and mammalian viruses have also hijacked Bend genes into
   their genome. However, the phylogenetic classification and evolution of
   these viral BEN domains remain unclear. Building on our previous finding
   that in silico method accurately determine the 3D model of BEN domains,
   we used AlphaFold2 to predict the tertiary structures of poxviral BEN
   domains for comprehensive homologous comparison. We revealed that the
   majority of poxviral BEN modules exhibit characteristics of type II BEN.
   Additionally, electrostatic surface potential analysis found various
   poxviral BEN domains, including the first BEN of OPG067 in
   Orthopoxvirus, the third BEN of OPG067 in Yatapoxvirus and the third BEN
   of MC036R in MCV, have positively charged protein surfaces, indicating a
   structural basis for DNA loading. Notably, MC036R shares structural
   resemblance with human BEND3, as they both contain four BEN domains and
   an intrinsically disordered region. In summary, our discoveries provide
   deeper insights into the functional roles of BEN proteins within
   poxviruses.},

Title = {Modeling transcription factor binding events to DNA using a random
   walker/jumper representation on a 1D/2D lattice with different affinity
   sites},
Journal = {PHYSICAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {4},

Abstract = {Surviving in a diverse environment requires corresponding organism
   responses. At the cellular level, such adjustment relies on the
   transcription factors (TFs) which must rapidly find their target
   sequences amidst a vast amount of non-relevant sequences on DNA
   molecules. Whether these transcription factors locate their target sites
   through a 1D or 3D pathway is still a matter of speculation. It has been
   suggested that the optimum search time is when the protein equally
   shares its search time between 1D and 3D diffusions. In this paper, we
   study the above problem using Monte Carlo simulations by considering a
   simple physical model. A 1D strip, representing a DNA, with a number of
   low affinity sites, corresponding to non-target sites, and high affinity
   sites, corresponding to target sites, is considered and later extended
   to a 2D strip. We study the 1D and 3D exploration pathways, and
   combinations thereof by considering three different types of molecules:
   a walker that randomly walks along the strip with no dissociation; a
   jumper that represents dissociation and then re-association of a TF with
   the strip at later time at a distant site; and a hopper that is similar
   to the jumper but it dissociates and then re-associates at a faster rate
   than the jumper. We analyze the final probability distribution of
   molecules for each case and find that TFs can locate their targets on
   the experimental time scale even if they spend only 15\% of their search
   time diffusing freely in the solution. This agrees with recent
   experimental results obtained by Elf et al (2007 Science 316 1191) and
   is in contrast to previously reported theoretical predictions. Our
   results also agree with the experimental evidence for the role of
   chaperons and proteasomes in stabilizing and destabilizing TFs binding,
   respectively, during the regulation process. Therefore, the results of
   our manuscript can provide a refined theoretical framework for the
   process.},

Journal = {CHROMOSOME RESEARCH},

Abstract = {The 3D localization of the 5S ribosomal RNA genes was studied in cells
   of the cortex zone of roots in the plant species Petunia hybrida inbred
   line V26 and in Crepis capillaris. The analysis was carried out on
   interphase nuclei (both species) and on prophase nuclei (C. capillaris).
   The 5S ribosomal RNA genes were detected by fluorescence in-situ
   hybridization and 3D images were obtained by confocal scanning laser
   microscopy. In both plant species, the 5S ribosomal genes were localized
   at the short arm of chromosome 2, which, in both plants, also possesses
   a satellite at its end. Statistical and visual analysis of interphase
   nuclei showed that: (1) there is a preference for an association of the
   5S rRNA gene clusters of the two homologous chromosomes, and (2) the 5S
   rRNA gene clusters in both species had a preserved spatial position
   within the interphase nucleus and they tended to be polarized with
   respect to their neighbouring cells (i.e. a relic telophase
   orientation). Moreover, tracing of the chromosomal segment between the
   5S loci and the active NOR revealed that the homologous chromosomes
   during early/mid prophase were aligned and that they entered the
   nucleolus side by side, at least for these chromosome segments. We
   interpret our data to mean that location of 5S rRNA near the nucleolus
   favours their functioning in ribosome biogenesis.},

Title = {Regulation of FGF-2, FGF-18 and Transcription Factor Activity by
   Perlecan in the Maturational Development of Transitional Rudiment and
   Growth Plate Cartilages and in the Maintenance of Permanent Cartilage
   Homeostasis},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES},

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to highlight the roles of perlecan in the
   regulation of the development of the rudiment developmental cartilages
   and growth plate cartilages, and also to show how perlecan maintains
   permanent articular cartilage homeostasis. Cartilage rudiments are
   transient developmental templates containing chondroprogenitor cells
   that undergo proliferation, matrix deposition, and hypertrophic
   differentiation. Growth plate cartilage also undergoes similar changes
   leading to endochondral bone formation, whereas permanent cartilage is
   maintained as an articular structure and does not undergo maturational
   changes. Pericellular and extracellular perlecan-HS chains interact with
   growth factors, morphogens, structural matrix glycoproteins, proteases,
   and inhibitors to promote matrix stabilization and cellular
   proliferation, ECM remodelling, and tissue expansion. Perlecan has
   mechanotransductive roles in cartilage that modulate chondrocyte
   responses in weight-bearing environments. Nuclear perlecan may modulate
   chromatin structure and transcription factor access to DNA and gene
   regulation. Snail-1, a mesenchymal marker and transcription factor,
   signals through FGFR-3 to promote chondrogenesis and maintain Acan and
   type II collagen levels in articular cartilage, but prevents further
   tissue expansion. Pre-hypertrophic growth plate chondrocytes also
   express high Snail-1 levels, leading to cessation of Acan and CoI2A1
   synthesis and appearance of type X collagen. Perlecan differentially
   regulates FGF-2 and FGF-18 to maintain articular cartilage homeostasis,
   rudiment and growth plate cartilage growth, and maturational changes
   including mineralization, contributing to skeletal growth.},

Abstract = {While colocalization within a bacterial operon enables coexpression of
   the constituent genes, the mechanistic logic of clustering of
   nonhomologous monocistronic genes in eukaryotes is not immediately
   obvious. Biosynthetic gene clusters that encode pathways for specialized
   metabolites are an exception to the classical eukaryote rule of random
   gene location and provide paradigmatic exemplars with which to
   understand eukaryotic cluster dynamics and regulation. Here, using 3C,
   Hi-C, and Capture Hi-C (CHi-C) organ-specific chromosome conformation
   capture techniques along with highresolution microscopy, we investigate
   how chromosome topology relates to transcriptional activity of clustered
   biosynthetic pathway genes in Arabidopsis thaliana. Our analyses reveal
   that biosynthetic gene clusters are embedded in local hot spots of 3D
   contacts that segregate cluster regions from the surrounding chromosome
   environment. The spatial conformation of these cluster-associated
   domains differs between transcriptionally active and silenced clusters.
   We further show that silenced clusters associate with heterochromatic
   chromosomal domains toward the periphery of the nucleus, while
   transcriptionally active clusters relocate away from the nuclear
   periphery. Examination of chromosome structure at unrelated clusters in
   maize, rice, and tomato indicates that integration of clustered pathway
   genes into distinct topological domains is a common feature in plant
   genomes. Our results shed light on the potential mechanisms that
   constrain coexpression within clusters of nonhomologous eukaryotic genes
   and suggest that gene clustering in the one-dimensional chromosome is
   accompanied by compartmentalization of the 3D chromosome.},

Abstract = {Chromosomes are large polymer molecules composed of nucleotides. In some
   species, such as humans, this polymer can sum up to meters long and
   still be properly folded within the nuclear space of few microns in
   size. The exact mechanisms of how the meters long DNA is folded into the
   nucleus, as well as how the regulatory machinery can access it, is to a
   large extend still a mystery. However, and thanks to newly developed
   molecular, genomic and computational approaches based on the Chromosome
   Conformation Capture (3C) technology, we are now obtaining insight on
   how genomes are spatially organized. Here we review a new family of
   computational approaches that aim at using 3C-based data to obtain
   spatial restraints for modeling genomes and genomic domains. (C) 2015

Title = {Gene regulation during development in the light of topologically

Year = {2016},
Volume = {5},

Abstract = {During embryonic development, complex transcriptional programs govern
   the precision of gene expression. Many key developmental genes are
   regulated via cis-regulatory elements that are located far away in the
   linear genome. How sequences located hundreds of kilobases away from a
   promoter can influence its activity has been the subject of numerous
   speculations, which all underline the importance of the 3D-organization
   of the genome. The recent advent of chromosome conformation capture
   techniques has put into focus the subdivision of the genome into
   topologically associating domains (TADs). TADs may influence regulatory
   activities on multiple levels. The relative invariance of TAD limits
   across cell types suggests that they may form fixed structural domains
   that could facilitate and/or confine long-range regulatory interactions.
   However, most recent studies suggest that interactions within TADs are
   more variable and dynamic than initially described. Hence, different
   models are emerging regarding how TADs shape the complex 3D
   conformations, and thereafter influence the networks of cis-interactions
   that govern gene expression during development. (C) 2015 Wiley

Title = {Telomere Distribution in Human Sperm Heads and Its Relation to Sperm
   Nuclear Morphology: A New Marker for Male Factor Infertility?},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {22},
Number = {14},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Infertility is a problem affecting an increasing number of couples
   worldwide. Currently, marker tests for male factor infertility are
   complex, highly technical and relatively subjective. Up to 40\% of cases
   of male factor infertility are currently diagnosed as idiopathic
   therefore, there is a clear need for further research into better ways
   of diagnosing it. Changes in sperm telomere length have been associated
   with infertility and closely linked to DNA damage and fragmentation,
   which are also known to be related to infertility. However, telomere
   distribution is a parameter thus far underexplored as an infertility
   marker. Here, we assessed morphological parameters of sperm nuclei in
   fertile control and male factor infertile cohorts. In addition, we used
   2D and 3D fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to compare telomere
   distribution between these two groups. Our findings indicate that the
   infertile cohort sperm nuclei were, on average, 2.9\% larger in area and
   showed subtle differences in sperm head height and width. Telomeres were
   mainly distributed towards the periphery of the nuclei in the control
   cohort, with diminishing telomere signals towards the center of the
   nuclei. Sperm nuclei of infertile males, however, had more telomere
   signals towards the center of the nuclei, a finding supported by 3D
   imaging. We conclude that, with further development, both morphology and
   telomere distribution may prove useful investigative tools in the
   fertility clinic.},

Title = {Transcription-dependent radial distribution of <i>TCF7L2</i> regulated

Journal = {CHROMOSOMA},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {126},
Number = {5},
Pages = {655-667},

Abstract = {Human chromosomes occupy distinct territories in the interphase nucleus.
   Such chromosome territories (CTs) are positioned according to gene
   density. Gene-rich CTs are generally located in the center of the
   nucleus, while gene-poor CTs are positioned more towards the nuclear
   periphery. However, the association between gene expression levels and
   the radial positioning of genes within the CT is still under debate. In
   the present study, we performed three-dimensional fluorescence in situ
   hybridization experiments in the colorectal cancer cell lines DLD-1 and
   LoVo using whole chromosome painting probes for chromosomes 8 and 11 and
   BAC clones targeting four genes with different expression levels
   assessed by gene expression arrays and RT-PCR. Our results confirmed
   that the two over-expressed genes, MYC on chromosome 8 and CCND1 on
   chromosome 11, are located significantly further away from the center of
   the CTcompared to under-expressed genes on the same chromosomes, i.e.,
   DLC1 and SCN3B. When CCND1 expression was reduced after silencing the
   major transcription factor of the WNT/beta-catenin signaling pathway,
   TCF7L2, the gene was repositioned and mostly detected in the interior of
   the CT. Thus, we suggest a non-random distribution in which
   over-expressed genes are located more towards the periphery of the
   respective CTs.},

Title = {Auxin-inducible degron 2 system deciphers functions of CTCF domains in
   transcriptional regulation},
Journal = {GENOME BIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {24},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 26},
Abstract = {BackgroundCTCF is a well-established chromatin architectural protein
   that also plays various roles in transcriptional regulation. While CTCF
   biology has been extensively studied, how the domains of CTCF function
   to regulate transcription remains unknown. Additionally, the original
   auxin-inducible degron 1 (AID1) system has limitations in investigating
   the function of CTCF.ResultsWe employ an improved auxin-inducible degron
   technology, AID2, to facilitate the study of acute depletion of CTCF
   while overcoming the limitations of the previous AID system. As
   previously observed through the AID1 system and steady-state RNA
   analysis, the new AID2 system combined with SLAM-seq confirms that CTCF
   depletion leads to modest nascent and steady-state transcript changes. A
   CTCF domain sgRNA library screening identifies the zinc finger (ZF)
   domain as the region within CTCF with the most functional relevance,
   including ZFs 1 and 10. Removal of ZFs 1 and 10 reveals genomic regions
   that independently require these ZFs for DNA binding and transcriptional
   regulation. Notably, loci regulated by either ZF1 or ZF10 exhibit unique
   CTCF binding motifs specific to each ZF.ConclusionsBy extensively
   comparing the AID1 and AID2 systems for CTCF degradation in SEM cells,
   we confirm that AID2 degradation is superior for achieving
   miniAID-tagged protein degradation without the limitations of the AID1
   system. The model we create that combines AID2 depletion of CTCF with
   exogenous overexpression of CTCF mutants allows us to demonstrate how
   peripheral ZFs intricately orchestrate transcriptional regulation in a
   cellular context for the first time.},

Abstract = {Chromosome organization poses a remarkable physical problem with many
   biological consequences: How can molecular interactions between proteins
   at the nanometer scale organize micron-long chromatinized DNA molecules,
   insulating or facilitating interactions between specific genomic
   elements? The mechanism of active loop extrusion holds great promise for
   explaining interphase and mitotic chromosome folding, yet remains
   difficult to assay directly. We discuss predictions from our polymer
   models of loop extrusion with barrier elements and review recent
   experimental studies that provide strong support for loop extrusion,
   focusing on perturbations to CTCF and cohesin assayed via Hi-C in
   interphase. Finally, we discuss a likely molecular mechanism of loop
   extrusion by structural maintenance of chromosomes complexes.},

Title = {NEUROD1 reinforces endocrine cell fate acquisition in pancreatic
   development},
Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {14},
Number = {1},
Month = {SEP 9},
Abstract = {NEUROD1 is a transcription factor that helps maintain a mature phenotype
   of pancreatic \& beta; cells. Disruption of Neurod1 during pancreatic
   development causes severe neonatal diabetes; however, the exact role of
   NEUROD1 in the differentiation programs of endocrine cells is unknown.
   Here, we report a crucial role of the NEUROD1 regulatory network in
   endocrine lineage commitment and differentiation. Mechanistically,
   transcriptome and chromatin landscape analyses demonstrate that Neurod1
   inactivation triggers a downregulation of endocrine differentiation
   transcription factors and upregulation of non-endocrine genes within the
   Neurod1-deficient endocrine cell population, disturbing endocrine
   identity acquisition. Neurod1 deficiency altered the H3K27me3 histone
   modification pattern in promoter regions of differentially expressed
   genes, which resulted in gene regulatory network changes in the
   differentiation pathway of endocrine cells, compromising endocrine cell
   potential, differentiation, and functional properties.
   Errors during pancreas development and specification of the endocrine
   lineage can result in severe neonatal diabetes. Here they show that loss
   of NEUROD1 leads to disturbances in endocrine cell identity acquisition
   during pancreas development, with cellular reprogramming occurring at
   the single-cell level within both \& alpha;- and \& beta;-cell
   populations.},

Title = {Unanticipated broad phylogeny of BEN DNA-binding domains revealed by
   structural homology searches},
Journal = {CURRENT BIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {33},
Number = {11},
Pages = {2270+},
Month = {JUN 5},
Abstract = {Organization of protein sequences into domain families is a foundation
   for cataloging and investigating pro-tein functions. However,
   long-standing strategies based on primary amino acid sequences are blind
   to the possibility that proteins with dissimilar sequences could have
   comparable tertiary structures. Building on our recent findings that in
   silico structural predictions of BEN family DNA-binding domains closely
   resemble their experimentally determined crystal structures, we
   exploited the AlphaFold2 database for comprehensive identification of
   BEN domains. Indeed, we identified numerous novel BEN domains, including
   members of new subfamilies. For example, while no BEN domain factors had
   previously been annotated in C. elegans, this species actually encodes
   multiple BEN proteins. These include key developmental timing genes of
   orphan domain status, sel-7 and lin-14, the latter being the central
   target of the founding miRNA lin-4. We also reveal that the domain of
   unknown function 4806 (DUF4806), which is widely distributed across
   meta-zoans, is structurally similar to BEN and comprises a new subtype.
   Surprisingly, we find that BEN domains resemble both metazoan and
   non-metazoan homeodomains in 3D conformation and preserve characteristic
   residues, indicating that despite their inability to be aligned by
   conventional methods, these DNA-binding modules are probably
   evolutionarily related. Finally, we broaden the application of
   structural homology searches by revealing novel human members of
   DUF3504, which exists on diverse proteins with presumed or known nuclear
   functions. Overall, our work strongly expands this recently identified
   family of transcription factors and illustrates the value of 3D
   structural predictions to annotate protein domains and interpret their
   functions.},

Journal = {CELL DEATH \& DISEASE},

Abstract = {Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most aggressive type of
   breast cancer that lacks the oestrogen receptor, progesterone receptor
   and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, making it difficult to
   target therapeutically. Targeting synthetic lethality is an alternative
   approach for cancer treatment. TNBC shows frequent loss of phosphatase
   and tensin homologue (PTEN) expression, which is associated with poor
   prognosis and treatment response. To identify PTEN synthetic lethal
   interactions, TCGA analysis coupled with a whole-genome siRNA screen in
   isogenic PTEN-negative and -positive cells were performed. Among the
   candidate genes essential for the survival of PTEN-inactive TNBC cells,
   WDHD1 (WD repeat and high-mobility group box DNA-binding protein 1)
   expression was increased in the low vs. high PTEN TNBC samples. It was
   also the top hit in the siRNA screen and its knockdown significantly
   inhibited cell viability in PTEN-negative cells, which was further
   validated in 2D and 3D cultures. Mechanistically, WDHD1 is important to
   mediate a high demand of protein translation in PTEN-inactive TNBC.
   Finally, the importance of WDHD1 in TNBC was confirmed in patient
   samples obtained from the TCGA and tissue microarrays with
   clinic-pathological information. Taken together, as an essential gene
   for the survival of PTEN-inactive TNBC cells, WDHD1 could be a potential
   biomarker or a therapeutic target for TNBC.},

Abstract = {The well-established human epidermal keratinocyte (HEK) differentiation
   model was investigated to determine possible alterations in chromosome
   territory (CT) association during differentiation. The seven human
   chromosomes (1, 4, 11, 12, 16, 17, and 18) selected for this analysis
   are representative of the chromosome size and gene density range of the
   overall human genome as well as including a majority of genes involved
   in epidermal development and differentiation (CT1, 12, and 17).
   Induction with calcium chloride (Ca2+) resulted in morphological changes
   characteristic of keratinocyte differentiation. Combined
   multi-fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and computational image
   analysis on the undifferentiated (0 h) and differentiated (24 h after
   Ca2+ treatment) HEK revealed that (a) increases in CT volumes correspond
   to overall nuclear volume increases, (b) radial positioning is gene
   density-dependent at 0 h but neither gene density- nor size-dependent at
   24 h, (c) the average number of interchromosomal associations for each
   CT is gene density-dependent and similar at both time points, and (d)
   there are striking differences in the single and multiple pairwise
   interchromosomal association profiles. Probabilistic network models of
   the overall interchromosomal associations demonstrate major
   reorganization of the network during differentiation. Only similar to 40
   \% of the CT pairwise connections in the networks are common to both 0
   and 24 h HEK. We propose that there is a probabilistic chromosome
   positional code which can be significantly altered during cell
   differentiation in coordination with reprogramming of gene expression.},

Title = {Discovery and Targeting of the Signaling Controls of <i>PNPLA3</i> to
   Effectively Reduce Transcription, Expression, and Function in
   Pre-Clinical NAFLD/NASH Settings},
Journal = {CELLS},

Abstract = {Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and non-alcoholic
   steatohepatitis (NASH) are emerging worldwide epidemics, projected to
   become the leading cause of liver transplants. The strongest genetic
   risk factor for NAFLD/NASH susceptibility and progression is a
   single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the patatin-like phospholipase
   domain-containing 3 gene (PNPLA3), rs738409, encoding the missense
   mutation I148M. This aminoacidic substitution interferes with the normal
   remodeling of lipid droplets in hepatocytes. It is also thought to play
   a key role in promoting liver fibrosis by inhibiting the release of
   retinol from hepatic stellate cells. Reducing PNPLA3 levels in
   individuals homozygous for 148M may be an effective treatment for the
   entire spectrum of NAFLD, based on gene dosage analysis in the human
   population, as well as the protective effect of another naturally
   occurring SNP (rs2294918) in PNPLA3 which, when co-inherited, reduces
   PNPLA3 mRNA levels to 50\% and counteracts disease risk. By screening a
   clinical compound library targeting specific signaling pathways active
   in primary human hepatocytes, we identified momelotinib, a drug
   evaluated in clinical trials to treat myelofibrosis, as a potent
   down-regulator of PNPLA3 expression, across all genotypes. We found that
   momelotinib treatment yielded >80\% reduction in PNPLA3 mRNA in human
   primary hepatocytes and stellate cells, as well as in vivo via acute and
   chronic treatment of WT mice. Using a human multilineage 3D spheroid
   model of NASH homozygous for the PNPLA3 mutant protein, we additionally
   show that it decreases PNPLA3 mRNA as well as intracellular lipid
   content. Furthermore, we show that the effects on PNPLA3 coincide with
   changes in chromatin accessibility within regulatory regions of the
   PNPLA3 locus, consistent with inhibition occurring at the level of
   transcription. In addition to its primary reported targets, the JAK
   kinases, momelotinib inhibits several non-JAK kinases, including ACVR1.
   Using a combination of targeted siRNA knockdowns and signaling pathway
   perturbations, we show that momelotinib reduces the expression of the
   PNPLA3 gene largely through the inhibition of BMP signaling rather than
   the JAK/STAT pathway. Overall, our work identified momelotinib as a
   potential NASH therapeutic and uncovered previously unrecognized
   connections between signaling pathways and PNPLA3. These pathways may be
   exploited by drug modalities to ``tune down{''} the level of gene
   expression, and therefore offer a potential therapeutic benefit to a
   high at-risk subset of NAFLD/NASH patients.},

   nonnucleotidic linkers, particularly, branching units for connecting
   three or more oligonucleotide chains. For the design and 3D modelling of
   such nanostructures as DNA tetrahedron, DNA cube and DNA fullerene C24,
   we have used Blender software. As we found, Blender not only allows one

Title = {Ligand dependent gene regulation by transient ERα clustered enhancers},
Journal = {PLOS GENETICS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {16},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Unliganded Estrogen receptor alpha (ER alpha) has been implicated in
   ligand-dependent gene regulation. Upon ligand exposure, ER alpha binds
   to several EREs relatively proximal to the pre-marked, unliganded ER
   alpha-bound sites and affects transient but robust gene expression.
   However, the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Here we
   demonstrate that upon ligand stimulation, persistent sites interact
   extensively, via chromatin looping, with the proximal transiently ER
   alpha-bound sites, forming Ligand Dependent ER alpha Enhancer Cluster in
   3D (LDEC). The E2-target genes are regulated by these clustered
   enhancers but not by the H3K27Ac super-enhancers. Further, CRISPR-based
   deletion of TFF1 persistent site disrupts the formation of its LDEC
   resulting in the loss of E2-dependent expression of TFF1 and its
   neighboring genes within the same TAD. The LDEC overlap with nuclear ER
   alpha condensates that coalesce in a ligand and persistent site
   dependent manner. Furthermore, formation of clustered enhancers, as well
   as condensates, coincide with the active phase of signaling and their
   later disappearance results in the loss of gene expression even though
   persistent sites remain bound by ER alpha. Our results establish, at
   TFF1 and NRIP1 locus, a direct link between ER alpha condensates, ER
   alpha enhancer clusters, and transient, but robust, gene expression in a
   ligand-dependent fashion.
   Author summary
   ER alpha occupies its cognate binding sites on the genome, upon estrogen
   stimulation, to bring about the signaling mediated response. However, ER
   alpha has been implicated in gene regulation even in the absence of
   hormone and its underlying mechanisms are not known. Here we show that,
   unliganded ER alpha-bound genomic sites are necessary for the emergence
   of active enhancers upon estrogen stimulation. Several ER alpha sites
   emerge in proximity to these unliganded ER alpha sites which loop with
   each other in three-dimensional nuclear space forming the enhancer:ER
   alpha clusters that we call Ligand dependent enhancer clusters (LDEC).
   These clusters are essential for expression of genes that are associated
   with the LDEC's as deletion of unliganded ER alpha-bound site completely
   perturbs the formation of clusters and expression of genes within the
   same TAD while clusters in neighboring TAD remain unaffected. At the
   mesoscale, these LDEC's appear as ER alpha condensates that emerge
   dynamically only upon addition of hormone. Further, the disappearance of
   clusters coincide with the loss of gene expression and condensate
   disappearance, marking the end of signaling response.},

Abstract = {Due to recent advances in experimental and theoretical approaches, the
   dynamic three-dimensional organization (3D) of the nucleus has become a
   very active area of research in life sciences. We now understand that
   the linear genome is folded in ways that may modulate how genes are
   expressed during the basic functioning of cells. Importantly, it is now
   possible to build 3D models of how the genome folds within the nucleus
   and changes over time (4D). Because genome folding influences its
   function, this opens exciting new possibilities to broaden our
   understanding of the mechanisms that determine cell fate. However, the
   rapid evolution of methods and the increasing complexity of data can
   result in ambiguity and reproducibility challenges, which may hamper the
   progress of this field. Here, we describe such challenges ahead and
   provide guidelines to think about strategies for shared standardized
   validation of experimental 4D nucleome data sets and models.},

Abstract = {Over the past decade, it has become clear that mammalian genomes encode
   thousands of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), many of which are now
   implicated in diverse biological processes. Recent work studying the
   molecular mechanisms of several key examples-including Xist, which
   orchestrates Xchromosome inactivation-has provided new insights into how
   lncRNAs can control cellular functions by acting in the nucleus. Here we
   discuss emerging mechanistic insights into how lncRNAs can regulate gene
   expression by coordinating regulatory proteins, localizing to target
   loci and shaping three-dimensional (3D) nuclear organization. We explore
   these principles to highlight biological challenges in gene regulation,
   in which lncRNAs are well-suited to perform roles that cannot be carried
   out by DNA elements or protein regulators alone, such as acting as
   spatial amplifiers of regulatory signals in the nucleus.},

Title = {Therapeutic Potential of Long Non-Coding RNAs of HIV-1, SARS-CoV-2, and
   Endogenous Retroviruses},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN VIROLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2},
Month = {APR 29},
Abstract = {Long non-protein coding RNAs (lncRNAs, predicted to be up to 200,000 in
   the human genome) are nucleic acids of more than 200 nucleotides that
   not only play primordial roles in the regulation of chromatin states,
   but also are capable of decoying or scaffolding proteins (e.g.,
   transcription factors, TFs; host and viral proteins), DNA (e.g.,
   promoters and enhancers), and RNA (e.g., miRNAs and hnRNAs) in 3D
   conformations acting in a chaperonin-like fashion. Specifically, lncRNAs
   modulate gene expression during the regulatory layers of transcription,
   RNA processing (splicing and indirectly editing), translation, and
   post-translational modifications including phosphorylation, acetylation,
   and ubiquitination. Accumulated evidence indicates that lncRNAs regulate
   antiviral immune responses mainly by transcription of IFN regulatory
   factors 1 (IRF1) and 4 (IRF4), which contribute to type I interferon
   (IFN alpha and IFN beta) upregulation. Some of the most common TFs
   regulated by lncRNAs are TP53, CTCF, MYC, SOX2, EZH2 SFPQ, SUZ12, STAT1,
   STAT3, and NF-kappa B. In this review, the known functions of selected
   lncRNAs genes in HIV/AIDS (MALAT1, HEAL, NRON, TAR-gag,
   TP53COR1/lincRNA-p21, NEAT1, NKILA, LINC01426 {[}formerly Uc002yug.2],
   FAS-AS1, LINC00173 {[}formerly FLJ42957/NCRNA00173], GAS5, and
   HIV-encoded antisense lncRNA) and COVID-19 (EGOT, MALAT1, NEAT1, DANCR,
   HOTAIR, FENDRR, LINC1505, FALCOR, and HISLA) are discussed. Furthermore,
   MALAT1 is also involved in subsequent complications such as deep vein
   thrombosis (DVT) in COVID-19. In addition, after the increased
   understanding of the role of lncRNAs from Human Endogenous Retroviruses
   (HERVs, predicted to be at least 582 different with 725,763 repeats of
   them in the human genome) in cancer (TROJAN) and heart development
   (BANCR), transcripts of HERVs as lnc-EPAV and lnc-ALVA1-AS1 have
   recently drawn attention as host protective agents against viral
   infections. A deeper knowledge of host and viral lncRNAs interactions
   and their regulation will pave the way for the design of novel drugs
   inspired by host- and viral-encoded lncRNAs. These novel drugs have the
   potential to reduce the burden of HIV/AIDS and COVID-19 twofold: (1) by
   increasing their efficacy and (2) by minimizing the side effects of
   current drugs. We expect that lncRNA drugs will be able to modulate
   human and viral transcription in an unprecedented way but still
   effectively maintain homeostasis by deploying functionality below the
   pathogenic threshold.},

   structural reorganizations},
Journal = {BIOPHYSICS REVIEWS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {3},
Number = {4},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The cell fate decision-making process, which provides the capability of
   a cell transition to a new cell type, involves the reorganizations of 3D
   genome structures. Currently, the high temporal resolution picture of
   how the chromosome structural rearrangements occur and further influence
   the gene activities during the cell-state transition is still
   challenging to acquire. Here, we study the chromosome structural
   reorganizations during the cell-state transitions among the pluripotent
   embryonic stem cell, the terminally differentiated normal cell, and the
   cancer cell using a nonequilibrium landscape-switching model implemented
   in the molecular dynamics simulation. We quantify the chromosome
   (de)compaction pathways during the cell-state transitions and find that
   the two pathways having the same destinations can merge prior to
   reaching the final states. The chromosomes at the merging states have
   similar structural geometries but can differ in long-range compartment
   segregation and spatial distribution of the chromosomal loci and genes,
   leading to cell-type-specific transition mechanisms. We identify the
   irreversible pathways of chromosome structural rearrangements during the
   forward and reverse transitions connecting the same pair of cell states,
   underscoring the critical roles of nonequilibrium dynamics in the
   cell-state transitions. Our results contribute to the understanding of
   the cell fate decision-making processes from the chromosome structural
   perspective.},

Title = {5-Azacytidine- and retinoic-acid-induced reprogramming of DCCs into
   dormancy suppresses metastasis via restored TGF-β-SMAD4 signaling},

Abstract = {Disseminated cancer cells (DCCs) in secondary organs can remain dormant
   for years to decades before re-activating into overt metastasis.
   Microenvironmental signals leading to cancer cell chromatin remodeling
   and transcriptional reprogramming appear to control onset and escape
   from dormancy. Here, we reveal that the therapeutic combination of the
   DNA methylation inhibitor 5-azacytidine (AZA) and the retinoic acid
   receptor ligands all -trans retinoic acid (atRA) or AM80, an
   RARa-specific agonist, promotes stable dormancy in cancer cells.
   Treatment of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) or breast
   cancer cells with AZA+atRA induces a SMAD2/3/4-dependent transcriptional
   program that restores transforming growth factor b (TGF-b)-signaling and
   anti-proliferative function. Significantly, either combination, AZA+atRA
   or AZA+AM80, strongly suppresses HNSCC lung metastasis formation by
   inducing and maintaining solitary DCCs in a SMAD4+/NR2F1+
   non-proliferative state. Notably, SMAD4 knockdown is sufficient to drive
   resistance to AZA+atRA-induced dormancy. We conclude that therapeutic
   doses of AZA and RAR agonists may induce and/or maintain dormancy and
   significantly limit metastasis development.},

Title = {Genome organization during the cell cycle: unity in division},
Journal = {WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-SYSTEMS BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {9},
Number = {5},
Month = {SEP-OCT},
Abstract = {During the cell cycle, the genome must undergo dramatic changes in
   structure, from a decondensed, yet highly organized interphase structure
   to a condensed, generic mitotic chromosome and then back again. For
   faithful cell division, the genome must be replicated and chromosomes
   and sister chromatids physically segregated from one another. Throughout
   these processes, there is feedback and tension between the
   information-storing role and the physical properties of chromosomes.
   With a combination of recent techniques in fluorescence microscopy,
   chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C), biophysical experiments, and
   computational modeling, we can now attribute mechanisms to many
   long-observed features of chromosome structure changes during cell
   division. Apparent conflicts that arise when integrating the concepts
   from these different proposed mechanisms emphasize that orchestrating
   chromosome organization during cell division requires a complex system
   of factors rather than a simple pathway. Cell division is both essential
   for and threatening to proper genome organization. As interphase
   three-dimensional (3D) genome structure is quite static at a global
   level, cell division provides an important window of opportunity to make
   substantial changes in 3D genome organization in daughter cells,
   allowing for proper differentiation and development. Mistakes in the
   process of chromosome condensation or rebuilding the structure after
   mitosis can lead to diseases such as cancer, premature aging, and
   neurodegeneration.},

Title = {Super-Resolution Structural Characteristics of Subcellular Organelles in
   Living Cells},
Journal = {CHINESE JOURNAL OF LASERS-ZHONGGUO JIGUANG},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {49},
Number = {20},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Significance It is well-known that subcellular organelles are essential
   components of cells. Their morphological structures and dynamic
   characteristics directly reflect the physiological state of cells.
   Scientists have paid significant attention to the observation and
   analysis of the fine structures of subcellular organelles in living
   specimens.
   The emerging super-resolution microscopy (SRM) techniques in the early
   21st century, such as structured illumination microscopy (SIM),
   stimulated emission depletion (STED), and single-molecule localization
   microscopy (SMLM), skillfully bypass the limitation of the optical
   diffraction limit and effectively retain the advantages of optical
   microscopy. SRM techniques have been widely used in monitoring
   subcellular organelles in living cells.
   Progress This article systematically elaborates and analyzes the
   super-resolution structure characteristics of subcellular organelles in
   living cells. First, it briefly introduces the basic principles and
   fundamental characteristics of the three kinds of SRM techniques, i.e.,
   STED, SIM, and SMLM, and expounds their development status. Second, the
   super-resolution fine structures and dynamic characteristics of
   subcellular organelles, such as the nucleus, cytoskeleton,
   mitochondrion, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER), are presented.
   In 2016, Chagin et al. quantitatively measured and analyzed replication
   foci (RF) in mammalian cells using three-dimensional (3D) SIM.
   Mitchell-Jordan et al. (2012) directly imaged histone protein H3 in
   mammalian cells using STED to show the chromatin domain characteristics
   at the scale of 40-70 nm. Wombacher et al. and LukinaviCius et al. also
   employed STORM to observe the distribution of histone protein H2B in
   living HeLa and U20S cells, respectively. Pelicci et al. (2020) imaged
   nuclear Lamin-A in intact nuclei of living cells through SPLIT-STED.
   Otsuka et al. (2016) captured images of different steps involved in
   assembling the NPC in a human cell. Lu et al. and Zhao et al. also
   realized the NPC super-resolution fluorescence imaging using different
   methods.
   Gustafsson et al. (2009) employed SIM to monitor the dynamic
   characteristics and fine structures of microtubules. Additionally, Li
   Dong et al. further investigated the fine structures of the cytoskeleton
   based on SIM. Shao et al. (2011) clearly observed that microtubules in
   Drosophila S2 cells showed wrapped reticular structure and were
   distributed sparsely in these 3D-SIM images. Zhuang Xiaowei et al.
   (2012) revealed the 3D ultrastructure of the microfilament skeleton
   using the dual-objective STORM (Fig. 2). D' Este (2015) combined the
   two-color STED nanoscopy with SiR-Actin to show that the periodic
   cytoskeleton organization is ubiquity in axons and dendrites of living
   hippocampal neurons. LukinaviCius et al. (2014) disclosed the ninefold
   symmetry of the centrosome and the spatial organization of the actin in
   the axons of rats using STED. Recently, Wang et al. (2022) proposed
   JSFR-SIM and followed the microtubule motion in live COS-7 cells.
   Additionally, Shim et al. (2012) observed the dynamic processes of
   mitochondrial fission/fusion through the STORM images of the
   mitochondrial membrane of living BS-C-1 cells. In 2020, the image data,
   hyperfine structures of mitochondria, and dynamic processes at different
   time points in living HeLa cells were attainable using STORM. Huang et
   al. (2018) successfully found the changes in mitochondrial crista during
   the fission and fusion of the mitochondrial. They identified the
   inter-cristae mergence in a single non-fusion mitochondrion using the
   Hessian-SIM system suitable for long-term super-resolution imaging of
   living cells (Fig. 3). Guo et al. (2018) also combined multicolor
   imaging technology with the newly proposed GI-SIM to observe the
   mitochondrial fission/fusion events at the ER-mitochondria contact
   sites. Wang et al. (2019) and Yang et al. (2020) accomplished the
   dynamic monitoring of mitochondrial crista using STED (Fig. 4).
   Recently, Wang et al. (2022) visualized the mitochondrial dynamics of
   living COS-7 cells through JSFR-SIM. A mitochondrion extended a
   tubulation tip, made contact with another mitochondrion, and then
   immediately retreated in the opposite direction.
   Furthermore, Shim et al. (2012) successfully realized the STORM dynamic
   imaging of ER membrane (Fig. 5) and expressly observed the previously
   obscured details of morphological changes in ER remodeling. Georgiades
   et al. (2017) quantitatively analyzed the length and diameter of ER
   tubules using STORM. Guo et al. (2018) employed GI-SIM to obtain the
   formation and disappearance of ER contraction sites and the
   reconstruction of ER tubules in living COS-7 cells. Zhu et al. (2020)
   recently realized the real-time STED monitoring of 3D dynamic
   interaction between ER and mitochondria.
   Finally, the development potential of combining super-resolution imaging
   with machine learning in exploring the fine structures of subcellular
   organelles is discussed.
   Conclusion and Prospect It is an inevitable trend in cell image
   processing fields to apply deep learning algorithms in extracting
   information from subcellular super-resolution fluorescence images and
   help researchers analyze the image data. To achieve accurate and robust
   subcellular super-resolution image analysis, it is necessary to solve
   the problems of insufficient standardization of datasets and poor
   generalization ability of algorithm models. Key words},

Title = {BET Inhibition as a Rational Therapeutic Strategy for Invasive Lobular
   Breast Cancer},
Journal = {CLINICAL CANCER RESEARCH},

Volume = {25},

Pages = {7139-7150},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {Purpose: Invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) is a subtype of breast cancer
   accounting for 10\% of breast tumors. The majority of patients are
   treated with endocrine therapy; however, endocrine resistance is common
   in estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer and new therapeutic
   strategies are needed. Bromodomain and extraterminal inhibitors (BETi)
   are effective in diverse types of breast cancer but they have not yet
   been assessed in ILC.
   Experimental Design: We assessed whether targeting the BET proteins with
   JQ1 could serve as an effective therapeutic strategy in ILC in both 2D
   and 3D models. We used dynamic BH3 profiling and RNA-sequencing
   (RNA-seq) to identify transcriptional reprograming enabling resistance
   to JQ1-induced apoptosis. As part of the RATHER study, we obtained
   copy-number alterations and RNA-seq on 61 ILC patient samples.
   Results: Certain ILC cell lines were sensitive to JQ1, while others were
   intrinsically resistant to JQ1-induced apoptosis. JQ1 treatment led to
   an enhanced dependence on antiapoptotic proteins and a transcriptional
   rewiring inducing fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1). This
   increase in FGFR1 was also evident in invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC)
   cell lines. The combination of JQ1 and FGFR1 inhibitors was highly
   effective at inhibiting growth in both 2D and 3D models of ILC and IDC.
   Interestingly, we found in the RATHER cohort of 61 ILC patients that
   20\% had FGFR1 amplification and we showed that high BRD3 mRNA
   expression was associated with poor survival specifically in ILC.
   Conclusions: We provide evidence that BETi either alone or in
   combination with FGFR1 inhibitors or BH3 mimetics may be a useful
   therapeutic strategy for recurrent ILC patients.},

Title = {Probing the target search of DNA-binding proteins in mammalian cells
   using TetR as model searcher},
Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {6},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Many cellular functions rely on DNA-binding proteins finding and
   associating to specific sites in the genome. Yet the mechanisms
   underlying the target search remain poorly understood, especially in the
   case of the highly organized mammalian cell nucleus. Using as a model
   Tet repressors (TetRs) searching for a multi-array locus, we
   quantitatively analyse the search process in human cells with
   single-molecule tracking and single-cell protein-DNA association
   measurements. We find that TetRs explore the nucleus and reach their
   target by 3D diffusion interspersed with transient interactions with
   non-cognate sites, consistent with the facilitated diffusion model.
   Remarkably, nonspecific binding times are broadly distributed,
   underlining a lack of clear delimitation between specific and
   nonspecific interactions. However, the search kinetics is not determined
   by diffusive transport but by the low association rate to nonspecific
   sites. Altogether, our results provide a comprehensive view of the
   recruitment dynamics of proteins at specific loci in mammalian cells.},

Title = {At the nuclear envelope of bone mechanobiology},
Journal = {BONE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {151},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The nuclear envelope and nucleoskeleton are emerging as signaling
   centers that regulate how physical information from the extracellular
   matrix is biochemically transduced into the nucleus, affecting chromatin
   and controlling cell function. Bone is a mechanically driven tissue that
   relies on physical information to maintain its physiological function
   and structure. Disorder that present with musculoskeletal and cardiac
   symptoms, such as Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophies and progeria,
   correlate with mutations in nuclear envelope proteins including Linker
   of Nucleoskeleton and Cytoskeleton (LINC) complex, Lamin A/C, and
   emerin. However, the role of nuclear envelope mechanobiology on bone
   function remains underexplored. The mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) model is
   perhaps the most studied relationship between bone regulation and
   nuclear envelope function. MSCs maintain the musculoskeletal system by
   differentiating into multiple cell types including osteocytes and
   adipocytes, thus supporting the bone's ability to respond to mechanical
   challenge. In this review, we will focus on how MSC function is
   regulated by mechanical challenges both in vitro and in vivo within the
   context of bone function specifically focusing on integrin, beta-catenin
   and YAP/TAZ signaling. The importance of the nuclear envelope will be
   explored within the context of musculoskeletal diseases related to
   nuclear envelope protein mutations and nuclear envelope regulation of
   signaling pathways relevant to bone mechanobiology in vitro and in vivo.},

Month = {JAN 19},
Abstract = {We use data-driven physical simulations to study the three-dimensional
   architecture of the Aedes aegypti genome. Hi-C maps exhibit both a broad
   diagonal and compartmentalization with telomeres and centromeres
   clustering together. Physical modeling reveals that these observations
   correspond to an ensemble of 3D chromosomal structures that are folded
   over and partially condensed. Clustering of the centromeres and
   telomeres near the nuclear lamina appears to be a necessary condition
   for the formation of the observed structures. Further analysis of the
   mechanical properties of the genome reveals that the chromosomes of
   Aedes aegypti, by virtue of their atypical structural organization, are
   highly sensitive to the deformation of the nuclei. This last finding
   provides a possible physical mechanism linking mechanical cues to gene
   regulation.},

Abstract = {Sixty years ago, the position of a gene on a chromosome was seen to be a
   major determinant of gene activity; however, position effects are rarely
   central to current discussions of gene expression. We describe a
   comprehensive and simplifying view of how position in 1D sequence and 3D
   nuclear space underlies expression. We suggest that apparently-different
   regulatory motifs including enhancers, silencers, insulators, barriers,
   and boundaries act similarly - they are active promoters that tether
   target genes close to, or distant from, appropriate transcription sites
   or `factories'. We also suggest that any active transcription unit
   regulates the firing of its neighbors - and thus can be categorized as
   one or other type of motif; this is consistent with expression
   quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) being widely dispersed.},

Abstract = {Little is known about chromosomal loopings involving proximal promoter
   and distal enhancer elements regulating GABAergic gene expression,
   including changes in schizophrenia and other psychiatric conditions
   linked to altered inhibition. Here, we map in human chromosome 2q31 the
   3D configuration of 200 kb of linear sequence encompassing the GAD1 GABA
   synthesis enzyme gene locus, and we describe a loop formation involving
   the GAD1 transcription start site and intergenic noncoding DNA elements
   facilitating reporter gene expression. The GAD1-TSS-50kbLoop was
   enriched with nucleosomes epigenetically decorated with the
   transcriptional mark, histone H3 trimethylated at lysine 4, and was weak
   or absent in skin fibroblasts and pluripotent stem cells compared with
   neuronal cultures differentiated from them. In the prefrontal cortex of
   subjects with schizophrenia, GAD1-TSS-50kbLoop was decreased compared
   with controls, in conjunction with downregulated GAD1 expression. We
   generated transgenic mice expressing Gad2 promoter-driven green
   fluorescent protein-conjugated histone H2B and confirmed that
   Gad1-TSS-55kbLoop, the murine homolog to GAD1-TSS-50kbLoop, is a
   chromosomal conformation specific for GABAergic neurons. In primary
   neuronal culture, Gad1-TSS-55kbLoop and Gad1 expression became
   upregulated when neuronal activity was increased. We conclude that 3D
   genome architectures, including chromosomal loopings for
   promoter-enhancer interactions involved in the regulation of GABAergic
   gene expression, are conserved between the rodent and primate brain, and
   subject to developmental and activity-dependent regulation, and
   disordered in some cases with schizophrenia. More broadly, the findings
   presented here draw a connection between noncoding DNA, spatial genome
   architecture, and neuronal plasticity in development and disease.},

Title = {Distinct nuclear orientation patterns for mouse chromosome 11 in normal
   B lymphocytes},
Journal = {BMC CELL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {15},
Month = {JUN 12},
Abstract = {Background: Characterizing the nuclear orientation of chromosomes in the
   three-dimensional (3D) nucleus by multicolor banding (mBANDing) is a new
   approach towards understanding nuclear organization of chromosome
   territories. An mBANDing paint is composed of multiple overlapping
   subchromosomal probes that represent different regions of a single
   chromosome. In this study, we used it for the analysis of chromosome
   orientation in 3D interphase nuclei. We determined whether the nuclear
   orientation of the two chromosome 11 homologs was random or
   preferential, and if it was conserved between diploid mouse Pre B
   lymphocytes of BALB/c origin and primary B lymphocytes of congenic
   {[}T38HxBALB/c] N wild-type mice. The chromosome orientation was
   assessed visually and through a semi-automated quantitative analysis of
   the radial and angular orientation patterns observed in both B cell
   types.
   Results: Our data indicate that there are different preferential
   patterns of chromosome 11 orientation, which are not significantly
   different between both mouse cell types (p > 0.05). In the most common
   case for both cell types, both copies of chromosome 11 were oriented in
   parallel with the nuclear border. The second most common pattern in both
   types of B lymphocytes was with one homolog of chromosome 11 positioned
   with its telomeric end towards the nuclear center and with its
   centromeric end towards the periphery, while the other chromosome 11 was
   found parallel with the nuclear border. In addition to these two most
   common orientations present in approximately 50\% of nuclei from each
   cell type, other orientations were observed at lower frequencies.
   Conclusions: We conclude that there are probabilistic, non-random
   orientation patterns for mouse chromosome 11 in the mouse B lymphocytes
   we investigated (p < 0.0001).},

   chromosomes},
Journal = {CHROMOSOME RESEARCH},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {25},

Abstract = {During meiotic prophase, cohesin complexes mediate cohesion between
   sister chromatids and promote pairing and synapsis of homologous
   chromosomes. Precisely how the activity of cohesin is controlled to
   promote these events is not fully understood. In metazoans, cohesion
   establishment between sister chromatids during mitotic divisions is
   accompanied by recruitment of the cohesion-stabilizing protein Sororin.
   During somatic cell division cycles, Sororin is recruited in response to
   DNA replication-dependent modification of the cohesin complex by ESCO
   acetyltransferases. How Sororin is recruited and acts in meiosis is less
   clear. Here, we have surveyed the chromosomal localization of Sororin
   and its relationship to the meiotic cohesins and other chromatin
   modifiers with the objective of determining how Sororin contributes to
   meiotic chromosome dynamics. We show that Sororin localizes to the cores
   of meiotic chromosomes in a manner that is dependent on synapsis and the
   synaptonemal complex protein SYCP1. In contrast, cohesin, with which
   Sororin interacts in mitotic cells, shows axial enrichment on meiotic
   chromosomes even in the absence of synapsis between homologs. Using
   high-resolution microscopy, we show that Sororin is localized to the
   central region of the synaptonemal complex. These results indicate that
   Sororin regulation during meiosis is distinct from its regulation in
   mitotic cells and may suggest that it interacts with a distinctly
   different partner to ensure proper chromosome dynamics in meiosis.},

Title = {Nucleosome structure incorporated histone acetylation site prediction in
   <i>arabidopsis thaliana</i>},
Journal = {BMC GENOMICS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {11},
Number = {2},
Month = {NOV 2},
Abstract = {Background: Acetylation is a crucial post-translational modification for
   histones, and plays a key role in gene expression regulation. Due to
   limited data and lack of a clear acetylation consensus sequence, a few
   researches have focused on prediction of lysine acetylation sites.
   Several systematic prediction studies have been conducted for human and
   yeast, but less for Arabidopsis thaliana.
   Results: Concerning the insufficient observation on acetylation site, we
   analyzed contributions of the peptide-alignment-based distance
   definition and 3D structure factors in acetylation prediction. We found
   that traditional structure contributes little to acetylation site
   prediction. Identified acetylation sites of histones in Arabidopsis
   thaliana are conserved and cross predictable with that of human by
   peptide based methods. However, the predicted specificity is
   overestimated, because of the existence of non-observed acetylable site.
   Here, by performing a complete exploration on the factors that affect
   the acetylability of lysines in histones, we focused on the relative
   position of lysine at nucleosome level, and defined a new structure
   feature to promote the performance in predicting the acetylability of
   all the histone lysines in A. thaliana.
   Conclusion: We found a new spacial correlated acetylation factor, and
   defined a epsilon-N spacial location based feature, which contains five
   core spacial ellipsoid wired areas. By incorporating the new feature,
   the performance of predicting the acetylability of all the histone
   lysines in A. Thaliana was promoted, in which the previous mispredicted
   acetylable lysines were corrected by comparing to the peptide-based
   prediction.},

Abstract = {Recently we characterized a class of anti-cancer agents (curaxins) that
   disturbs DNA/histone interactions within nucleosomes. Here, using a
   combination of genomic and in vitro approaches, we demonstrate that
   curaxins strongly affect spatial genome organization and compromise
   enhancer-promoter communication, which is necessary for the expression
   of several oncogenes, including MYC. We further show that curaxins
   selectively inhibit enhancer-regulated transcription of chromatinized
   templates in cell-free conditions. Genomic studies also suggest that
   curaxins induce partial depletion of CTCF from its binding sites, which
   contributes to the observed changes in genome topology. Thus, curaxins
   can be classified as epigenetic drugs that target the 3D genome
   organization.},

   graph-based posterior regularizers that augment a probabilistic model by
   encouraging pairs of nearby variables in a regularization graph to have
   similar posterior distributions. We present a three-way alternating
   optimization algorithm with closed-form updates for performing inference
   on this joint model and learning its parameters. This method admits
   updates linear in the degree of the regularization graph, exhibits
   monotone convergence, and is easily parallelizable. We are motivated by
   applications in computational biology in which temporal models such as
   hidden Markov models are used to learn a human-interpretable
   representation of genomic data. On a synthetic problem, we show that our
   method outperforms existing methods for graph-based regularization and a
   comparable strategy for incorporating long-range interactions using
   existing methods for approximate inference. Using genome-scale
   functional genomics data, we integrate genome 3D interaction data into
   existing models for genome annotation and demonstrate significant
   improvements in predicting genomic activity.(1)},

Title = {Modeling the influence of nucleus elasticity on cell invasion in fiber

Abstract = {Cell migration in highly constrained extracellular matrices is exploited
   in scaffold-based tissue engineering and is fundamental in a wide
   variety of physiological and pathological phenomena, among others in
   cancer invasion and development. Research into the critical processes
   involved in cell migration has mainly focused on cell adhesion and
   proteolytic degradation of the external environment. However, rising
   evidence has recently shown that a number of cell-derived biophysical
   and mechanical parameters, among others nucleus stiffness and cell
   deformability, plays a major role in cell motility, especially in the
   ameboid-like migration mode in 3D confined tissue structures. We here
   present an extended cellular Potts model (CPM) first used to simulate a
   micro-fabricated migration chip, which tests the active invasive
   behavior of cancer cells into narrow channels. As distinct features of
   our approach, cells are modeled as compartmentalized discrete objects,
   differentiated in the nucleus and in the cytosolic region, while the
   migration chamber is composed of channels of different widths. We find
   that cell motile phenotype and velocity in open spaces (i.e., 2D flat
   surfaces or large channels) are not significantly influenced by cell
   elastic properties. On the contrary, the migratory behavior of cells
   within subcellular and subnuclear structures strongly relies on the
   deformability of the cytosol and of the nuclear cluster, respectively.
   Further, we characterize two migration dynamics: a stepwise way,
   characterized by fluctuations in cell length, within channels smaller
   than nucleus dimensions and a smooth sliding (i.e., maintaining constant
   cell length) behavior within channels larger than the nuclear cluster.
   These resulting observations are then extended looking at cell migration
   in an artificial fiber network, which mimics cell invasion in a 3D
   extracellular matrix. In particular, in this case, we analyze the effect
   of variations in elasticity of the nucleus on cell movement. In order to
   summarize, with our simulated migration assays, we demonstrate that the
   dimensionality of the environment strongly affects the migration
   phenotype and we suggest that the cytoskeletal and nuclear elastic
   characteristics correlate with the tumor cell's invasive potential. (C)

Title = {Spatial distribution of lamin A/C determines nuclear stiffness and
   stress-mediated deformation},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CELL SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {134},
Number = {10},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {While diverse cellular components have been identified as
   mechanotransduction elements, the deformation of the nucleus itself is a
   critical mechanosensory mechanism, implying that nuclear stiffness is
   essential in determining responses to intracellular and extracellular
   stresses. Although the nuclear membrane protein lamin A/C is known to
   contribute to nuclear stiffness, bulk moduli of nuclei have not been
   reported for various levels of lamin A/C. Here, we measure the nuclear
   bulk moduli as a function of lamin A/C expression and applied osmotic
   stress, revealing a linear dependence within the range of 2-4 MPa. We
   also find that the nuclear compression is anisotropic, with the vertical
   axis of the nucleus being more compliant than the minor and major axes
   in the substrate plane. We then related the spatial distribution of
   lamin A/C with submicron 3D nuclear envelope deformation, revealing that
   local areas of the nuclear envelope with higher density of lamin NC have
   correspondingly lower local deformations. These findings describe the
   complex dispersion of nuclear deformations as a function of lamin A/C
   expression and distribution, implicating a lamin A/C role in
   mechanotransduction.

Abstract = {The cellular machinery involved in the internalization of nonviral gene
   carriers and their subsequent trafficking to the nucleus directly
   impacts their therapeutic efficiency. Hence, identifying key endocytic
   pathways and organelles that contribute to the successful transfer of
   polyplexes to the nucleus generates new opportunities for improving
   carrier design. Previously, we showed that histone H3 tail peptides
   encoding a sequence known to participate in chromatin activation exhibit
   synergistic gene delivery activity with poly(ethylenimine) (PEI).
   Polyplexes containing H3 and PEI exhibited a reduced dependence on
   endocytic pathways that trafficked to lysosomes, and had enhanced
   sensitivity to an inhibitor associated with retrograde trafficking
   through the Golgi apparatus. Thus, we sought to determine whether
   caveolar uptake and transport through the Golgi and/or endoplasmic
   reticulum (ER) preceded nuclear delivery. By the use of a panel of
   chemical endocytic inhibitors, we determined that H3 polyplexes utilized
   caveolar pathways to a greater degree than PEI polyplexes.
   Caveolae-mediated endocytosis was found to be a productive route for
   gene expression by the H3/PEI-pDNA polyplexes, consistent with previous
   studies of polymer-mediated gene delivery. Additionally, the polyplexes
   substantially colocalized within the ER after only 5 min of incubation,
   and utilized retrograde Golgi-to-ER pathways at levels similar to
   pathogens known to traffic by these routes during infection. The results
   of this study have expanded our understanding of how caveolar polyplexes
   are trafficked to cell nuclei, and provide new evidence for the role of
   Golgi-ER pathways in transfection. These findings suggest new design
   criteria and opportunities to stragetically target nonviral gene
   delivery vehicles.},

Title = {QSAR analysis of coumarin-based benzamides as histone deacetylase

Abstract = {Histone deacetylases (HDACs) as the promising therapeutic targets for
   the treatment of cancer and other diseases, modify chromatin structure
   and contribute to aberrant gene expression in cancer. Inhibition of
   HDACs is emerging as an important strategy in human cancer therapy and
   HDAC inhibitors (HDACIs) enable histone to maintain a high degree of
   acetylation. In this work, molecular modeling studies, including CoMFA,
   CoMFA-RF, CoMSIA and HQSAR and molecular docking were performed on a
   series of coumarin-based benzamides as HDAC inhibitors. The statistical
   qualities of generated models were justified by internal and external
   validation, i.e., cross-validated correlation coefficient (q(2)),
   non-cross-validated correlation coefficient (r(ncv)(2)) and predicted
   correlation coefficient (r(pred)(2)) respectively. The CoMFA
   (q(2).0.728; r(ncv)(2), 0.982; r(pred)(2), 0.685), CoMFA-RF (q(2),
   0.764; q(ncv)(2), 0.960; r(pred)(2), 0.552), CoMSIA (q(2), 0.671;
   r(ncv)(2), 0.977; r(pred)(2), 0.721) and HQSAR models (q(2), 0.811;
   r(ncv)(2), 0.986; r(pred)(2), 0.613) for training and test set of HDAC
   inhibition of HCT116 cell line yielded significant statistical results.
   Therefore, these QSAR models were excellent, robust and had better
   predictive capability. Contour maps of the QSAR models were generated
   and validated by molecular docking study. The final QSAR models could be
   useful for the design and development of novel potent HDAC inhibitors in
   cancer treatment. The amido and amine groups of benzamide part as
   scaffold and the bulk groups as a hydrophobic part were key factors to
   improve inhibitory activity of HDACIs. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier

Title = {Assessing Human Genetic Variations in Glucose Transporter SLC2A10 and
   Their Role in Altering Structural and Functional Properties},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN GENETICS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {9},
Month = {JUL 25},
Abstract = {Purpose: Demand is increasing for clinical genomic sequencing to provide
   diagnoses for patients presenting phenotypes indicative of genetic
   diseases, but for whom routine genetic testing failed to yield a
   diagnosis. DNA-based testing using high-throughput technologies often
   identifies variants with insufficient evidence to determine whether they
   are disease-causal or benign, leading to categorization as variants of
   uncertain significance (VUS).
   Methods: We used molecular modeling and simulation to generate specific
   hypotheses for the molecular effects of variants in the human glucose
   transporter, GLUT10 (SLC2A10). Similar to many disease-relevant membrane
   proteins, no experimentally derived 3D structure exists. An atomic model
   was generated and used to evaluate multiple variants, including
   pathogenic, benign, and VUS.
   Results: These analyses yielded detailed mechanistic data, not currently
   predictable from sequence, including altered protein stability, charge
   distribution of ligand binding surfaces, and shifts toward or away from
   transport-competent conformations. Consideration of the two major
   conformations of GLUT10 was important as variants have
   conformation-specific effects. We generated detailed molecular
   hypotheses for the functional impact of variants in GLUT10 and propose
   means to determine their pathogenicity.
   Conclusion: The type of workflow we present here is valuable for
   increasing the throughput and resolution with which VUS effects can be
   assessed and interpreted.},

Title = {Laser confocal microscopy analysis of human interphase nuclei by
   three-dimensional FISH reveals dynamic perinucleolar clustering of
   telomeres},
Journal = {CYTOGENETIC AND GENOME RESEARCH},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {122},
Number = {3-4},
Pages = {237-242},
Abstract = {Nuclear functions are strongly dependent on the three-dimensional
   organization of the interphase nucleus. Given the importance of
   telomeres in the behaviour and stability of chromosomes, we have
   investigated the architecture of the human nucleus from the telomere
   perspective by 3D-FISH and laser confocal microscopy. We observed a
   randomly scattered telomere distribution in all confocal sections of the
   interphase nuclear volume with various levels of telomere clustering in
   different cell types. This distribution is independent of H2AX presence
   or phosphorylation status. We also observed that telomeres usually
   cluster at the periphery of the nucleolus following its cell cycle
   dependent dynamic formation but are never present in the interior of the
   nucleolus. These perinucleolar telomeric clusters contain the telomeres
   of the short arms of acrocentric chromosomes, explaining the p-arm
   association of acrocentric chromosomes frequently found in metaphase.
   Thus, chromosome positioning in metaphase spreads is tightly connected
   to the three-dimensional architecture of the interphase nucleus.

Title = {Importin ?/? promote Kif18B microtubule association and enhance

Journal = {MOLECULAR BIOLOGY OF THE CELL},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {34},
Number = {4},
Pages = {15-21},
Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {Tight regulation of microtubule (MT) dynamics is necessary for proper
   spindle assembly and chromosome segregation. The MT destabilizing
   Kinesin-8, Kif18B, controls astral MT dynamics and spindle positioning.
   Kif18B interacts with importin alpha/beta as well as with the plus-tip
   tracking protein EB1, but how these associations modulate Kif18B is not
   known. We mapped the key binding sites on Kif18B, made residue-specific
   mutations, and assessed their impact on Kif18B function. Blocking EB1
   interaction disrupted Kif18B MT plus-end accumulation and inhibited its
   ability to control MT length on monopolar spindles in cells. Blocking
   importin alpha/beta interaction disrupted Kif18B localization without
   affecting aster size. In vitro, importin alpha/beta increased Kif18B MT
   association by increasing the on-rate and decreasing the off-rate from
   MTs, which stimulated MT destabilization. In contrast, EB1 promoted MT
   destabilization without increasing lattice binding in vitro, which
   suggests that EB1 and importin alpha/beta have distinct roles in the
   regulation of Kif18B-mediated MT destabilization. We propose that
   importin alpha/beta spatially modulate Kif18B association with MTs to
   facilitate its MT destabilization activity. Our results suggest that Ran
   regulation is important not only to control molecular motor function
   near chromatin but also to provide a spatial control mechanism to
   modulate MT binding of nuclear localization signal-containing spindle
   assembly factors.},

Title = {CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) and cohesin influence the genomic

   pro-B cells},

   AMERICA},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {108},
Number = {23},
Pages = {9566-9571},
Month = {JUN 7},
Abstract = {Compaction and looping of the similar to 2.5-Mb Igh locus during V(D)J
   rearrangement is essential to allow all V-H genes to be brought in
   proximity with D-H-J(H) segments to create a diverse antibody
   repertoire, but the proteins directly responsible for this are unknown.
   Because CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) has been demonstrated to be involved
   in long-range chromosomal interactions, we hypothesized that CTCF may
   promote the contraction of the Igh locus. ChIP sequencing was performed
   on pro-B cells, revealing colocalization of CTCF and Rad21 binding at
   similar to 60 sites throughout the V-H region and 2 other sites within
   the Igh locus. These numerous CTCF/cohesin sites potentially form the
   bases of the multiloop rosette structures at the Igh locus that compact
   during Ig heavy chain rearrangement. To test whether CTCF was involved
   in locus compaction, we used 3D-FISH to measure compaction in pro-B
   cells transduced with CTCF shRNA retroviruses. Reduction of CTCF binding
   resulted in a decrease in Igh locus compaction. Long-range interactions
   within the Igh locus were measured with the chromosomal conformation
   capture assay, revealing direct interactions between CTCF sites 5' of
   DFL16 and the 3' regulatory region, and also the intronic enhancer (E
   mu), creating a D-H-J(H)-E mu-C-H domain. Knock-down of CTCF also
   resulted in the increase of antisense transcription throughout the D-H
   region and parts of the V-H locus, suggesting a widespread regulatory
   role for CTCF. Together, our findings demonstrate that CTCF plays an
   important role in the 3D structure of the Igh locus and in the
   regulation of antisense germline transcription and that it contributes
   to the compaction of the Igh locus.},

Title = {Unraveling Heterogeneity in Epithelial Cell Fates of the Mammary Gland
   and Breast Cancer},
Journal = {CANCERS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Fluidity in cell fate or heterogeneity in cell identity is an
   interesting cell biological phenomenon, which at the same time poses a
   significant obstacle for cancer therapy. The mammary gland seems a
   relatively straightforward organ with stromal cells and basal- and
   luminal- epithelial cell types. In reality, the epithelial cell fates
   are much more complex and heterogeneous, which is the topic of this
   review. Part of the complexity comes from the dynamic nature of this
   organ: the primitive epithelial tree undergoes extensively remodeling
   and expansion during puberty, pregnancy, and lactation and, unlike most
   other organs, the bulk of mammary gland development occurs late, during
   puberty. An active cell biological debate has focused on lineage
   commitment to basal- and luminal- epithelial cell fates by epithelial
   progenitor and stem cells; processes that are also relevant to cancer
   biology. In this review, we discuss the current understanding of
   heterogeneity in mammary gland and recent insights obtained through
   lineage tracing, signaling assays, and organoid cultures. Lastly, we
   relate these insights to cancer and ongoing efforts to resolve
   heterogeneity in breast cancer with single-cell RNAseq approaches.},

Abstract = {Korean field mouse (Apodemus peninsulae) shows a wide variation in the
   number of B chromosomes composed of constitutive heterochromatin. For
   this reason, it provides a good model to study the influence of the
   number of centromeres and amount of heterochromatin on spatial
   organization of interphase nuclei. We analyzed the three-dimensional
   organization of fibroblast and spermatocyte nuclei of the field mice
   carrying a different number of B chromosomes using laser scanning
   microscopy and 3D fluorescence in situ hybridization. We detected a
   co-localization of the B chromosomes with constitutive heterochromatin
   of the chromosomes of the basic set. We showed a non-random distribution
   of B chromosomes in the spermatocyte nuclei. Unpaired B chromosomes
   showed a tendency to occur in the compartment formed by the unpaired
   part of the XY bivalent.},

   attachments in mammalian eggs},
Journal = {EMBO REPORTS},
Year = {2019},

Abstract = {The accuracy of the two sequential meiotic divisions in oocytes is
   essential for creating a haploid gamete with a normal chromosomal
   content. Here, we have analysed the 3D dynamics of chromosomes during
   the second meiotic division in live mouse oocytes. We find that
   chromosomes form stable kinetochore-microtubule attachments at the end
   of prometaphase II stage that are retained until anaphase II onset.
   Remarkably, we observe that more than 20\% of the
   kinetochore-microtubule attachments at the metaphase II stage are
   merotelic or lateral. However, II are found to lag at the spindle
   equator and < 10\% of the laggards missegregate and give rise to
   aneuploid gametes. Our results demonstrate that aberrant
   kinetochore-microtubule attachments are not corrected at the metaphase
   stage of the second meiotic division. Thus, the accuracy of the
   chromosome segregation process in mouse oocytes during meiosis II is
   ensured by an efficient correction process acting at the anaphase stage.},

Title = {Megadomains and superloops form dynamically but are dispensable for
   X-chromosome inactivation and gene escape},
Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {9},
Month = {NOV 27},
Abstract = {The mammalian inactive X-chromosome (Xi) is structurally distinct from
   all other chromosomes and serves as a model for how the 3D genome is
   organized. The Xi shows weakened topologically associated domains and is
   instead organized into megadomains and superloops directed by the
   noncoding loci, Dxz4 and Firre. Their functional significance is
   presently unclear, though one study suggests that they permit Xi genes
   to escape silencing. Here, we find that megadomains do not precede Xist
   expression or Xi gene silencing. Deleting Dxz4 disrupts the sharp
   megadomain border, whereas deleting Firre weakens intra-megadomain
   interactions. However, deleting Dxz4 and/or Firre has no impact on Xi
   silencing and gene escape. Nor does it affect Xi nuclear localization,
   stability, or H3K27 methylation. Additionally, ectopic integration of
   Dxz4 and Xist is not sufficient to form megadomains on autosomes. We
   conclude that Dxz4 and megadomains are dispensable for Xi silencing and
   escape from X-inactivation.},

Abstract = {The recent development of spatial omics methods has enabled single-cell
   profiling of the transcriptome and 3D genome organization with high
   spatial resolution. Expanding the repertoire of spatial omics tools, a
   spatially resolved single-cell epigenomics method will accelerate
   understanding of the spatial regulation of cell and tissue functions.
   Here, we report a method for spatially resolved epigenomic profiling of
   single cells using in situ tagmentation and transcription followed by
   multiplexed imaging. We demonstrated the ability to profile histone
   modifications marking active promoters, putative enhancers, and silent
   promoters in individual cells, and generated high-resolution spatial
   atlas of hundreds of active promoters and putative enhancers in
   embryonic and adult mouse brains. Our results suggested putative
   promoter-enhancer pairs and enhancer hubs regulating developmentally
   important genes. We envision this approach will be generally applicable
   to spatial profiling of epigenetic modifications and DNA-binding
   proteins, advancing our under-standing of how gene expression is
   spatiotemporally regulated by the epigenome.},

Abstract = {Cohesin is important for 3D genome organization. Nevertheless, even the
   complete removal of cohesin has surprisingly little impact on
   steady-state gene transcription and enhancer activity. Here we show that
   cohesin is required for the core transcriptional response of primary
   macrophages to microbial signals, and for inducible enhancer activity
   that underpins inflammatory gene expression. Consistent with a role for
   inflammatory signals in promoting myeloid differentiation of
   hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HPSCs), cohesin mutations in
   HSPCs led to reduced inflammatory gene expression and increased
   resistance to differentiation-inducing inflammatory stimuli. These
   findings uncover an unexpected dependence of inducible gene expression
   on cohesin, link cohesin with myeloid differentiation, and may help
   explain the prevalence of cohesin mutations in human acute myeloid
   leukemia.},

Abstract = {Background: The open and accessible regions of the chromosome are more
   likely to be bound by transcription factors which are important for
   nuclear processes and biological functions. Studying the change of
   chromosome flexibility can help to discover and analyze disease markers
   and improve the efficiency of clinical diagnosis. Current methods for
   predicting chromosome flexibility based on Hi-C data include the
   Flexibility-Rigidity Index (FRI) and the Gaussian Network Model (GNM),
   which have been proposed to characterize chromosome flexibility.
   However, these methods require the chromosome structure data based on 3D
   biological experiments, which is time-consuming and expensive.
   Objective: Generally, the folding and curling of the double helix
   sequence of DNA have a great impact on chromosome flexibility and
   function. Motivated by the success of genomic sequence analysis in
   biomolecular function analysis, we hope to propose a method to predict
   chromosome flexibility only based on genomic sequence data. Methods: We
   propose a new method (named ``DeepCFP{''}) using deep learning models to
   predict chromosome flexibility based on only genomic sequence features.
   The model has been tested in the GM12878 cell line. Results: The maximum
   accuracy of our model has reached 91\%. The performance of DeepCFP is
   close to FRI and GNM. Conclusion: The DeepCFP can achieve high
   performance only based on genomic sequence.},

Abstract = {The adult dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampal formation is a
   specialized region of the brain that creates new adult-born neurons from
   a pool of resident adult neural stem and progenitor cells (aNSPCs)
   throughout life. These aNSPCs undergo epigenetic and epitranscriptomic
   regulation, including 3D genome interactions, histone modifications, DNA
   modifications, noncoding RNA mechanisms, and RNA modifications, to
   precisely control the neurogenic process. Furthermore, the specialized
   neurogenic niche also uses epigenetic mechanisms in mature neurons and
   glial cells to communicate signals to direct the behavior of the aNSPCs.
   Here, we review recent advances of epigenetic regulation in aNSPCs and
   their surrounding niche cells within the adult DG.},

Title = {Specific features in linear and spatial organizations of pericentromeric

Abstract = {Heterochromatin plays an important role in the spatial arrangement and
   evolution of the eukaryotic genetic apparatus. The closely related
   species Drosophila virilis (phyla virilis) and D. kanekoi (phyla
   montana) differ in the amount of heterochromatin along the chromosomes
   as well as by the presence of the metacentric chromosome 2, which
   emerged as a result of a pericentric inversion during speciation, in the
   D. kanekoi karyotype. The purpose of this study was to establish if
   chromosome rearrangements have any influence on the linear
   redistribution of centromeric heterochromatin in polytene chromosomes
   and the spatial organization of chromosomes in the nuclei of nurse cell.
   We have microdissected the chromocenter of D. virilis salivary gland
   polytene chromosomes; obtained a DNA library of this region (DvirIII);
   and hybridized (FISH) DvirIII to the salivary gland and nurse cell
   polytene chromosomes of D. virilis and D. kanekoi. We demonstrated that
   DvirIII localizes to the pericentromeric heterochromatin regions of all
   chromosomes and peritelomeric region of chromosome 5 in both species.
   Unlike D. virilis, the DvirIII signal in D. kanekoi chromosomes is
   detectable in the telomeric region of chromosome 2. We have also
   conducted a 3D FISH of DvirIII probe to the D. virilis and D. kanekoi
   nurse cell chromosomes. In particular, the DvirIII signal in D. virilis
   was observed in the local chromocenter at one pole of the nucleus, while
   the signal belonging to the telomeric region of chromosome 5 was
   detectable at the other pole. In contrast, in D. kanekoi there exist two
   separate DvirIII-positive regions. One of these regions belongs to the
   pericentromeric region of chromosome 2 and the other, to pericentromeric
   regions of the remaining chromosomes. These results suggest that
   chromosome rearrangements play an important role in the redistribution
   of heterochromatin DNA sequences in the genome, representing a
   speciation mechanism, which, in general, could also affect the
   chromosome orientation in the 3D nuclear space.},

   four intrinsically bent DNA sites (b1 to b4) in a fragment that contains
   the oriGNA/3 and one site (b5) proximal to oriB. The helical parameters
   show that each bent DNA site is curved in a left-handed superhelical
   writhe. A 2D projection of 3D fragment trajectories revealed that
   oriGNA/3 is located in a relatively straight segment flanked by bent
   sites b1 and b2, which map in previously identified Scaffold/Matrix
   Attachment Region. Sites b3 and b4 are located approximately 2 kb
   downstream and force the fragment into a strong closed loop structure.
   The b5 site is also located in an S/MAR that is found just downstream of

Abstract = {The nucleolus is the largest and most studied nuclear body, but its role
   in nuclear function is far from being comprehensively understood. Much
   work on the nucleolus has focused on its role in regulating RNA
   polymerase I (RNA Pol I) transcription and ribosome biogenesis; however,
   emerging evidence points to the nucleolus as an organizing hub for many
   nuclear functions, accomplished via the shuttling of proteins and
   nucleic acids between the nucleolus and nucleoplasm. Here, we discuss
   the cellular mechanisms affected by shuttling of nucleolar components,
   including the 3D organization of the genome, stress response, DNA repair
   and recombination, transcription regulation, telomere maintenance, and
   other essential cellular functions.},

Journal = {MOLECULAR CELL},
Year = {2000},
Volume = {5},
Number = {2},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The crystal structure of a heterodimer between the ligand-binding
   domains (LBDs) of the human RAR alpha bound to a selective antagonist
   and the constitutively active mouse RXR alpha F318A mutant shows that,
   pushed by a bulky extension of the ligand, RAR alpha helix H12 adopts an
   antagonist position. The unexpected presence of a fatty acid in the
   ligand-binding pocket of RXR alpha F318A is likely to account for its
   apparent ``constitutivity.{''} Specific conformational changes suggest
   the structural basis of pure and partial antagonism. The RAR-RXR
   heterodimer interface is similar to that observed in most nuclear
   receptor (NR) homodimers. A correlative analysis of 3D structures and
   sequences provides a novel view on dimerization among members of the
   nuclear receptor superfamily.},

Title = {Trans- and cis-acting effects of <i>Firre</i> on epigenetic features of
   the inactive X chromosome},
Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {11},
Number = {1},
Month = {DEC 27},
Abstract = {Firre encodes a lncRNA involved in nuclear organization. Here, we show
   that Firre RNA expressed from the active X chromosome maintains histone
   H3K27me3 enrichment on the inactive X chromosome (Xi) in somatic cells.
   This trans-acting effect involves SUZ12, reflecting interactions between
   Firre RNA and components of the Polycomb repressive complexes. Without
   Firre RNA, H3K27me3 decreases on the Xi and the Xi-perinucleolar
   location is disrupted, possibly due to decreased CTCF binding on the Xi.
   We also observe widespread gene dysregulation, but not on the Xi. These
   effects are measurably rescued by ectopic expression of mouse or human
   Firre/FIRRE transgenes, supporting conserved trans-acting roles. We also
   find that the compact 3D structure of the Xi partly depends on the Firre
   locus and its RNA. In common lymphoid progenitors and T-cells Firre
   exerts a cis-acting effect on maintenance of H3K27me3 in a 26Mb region
   around the locus, demonstrating cell type-specific trans- and cis-acting
   roles of this lncRNA.},

Abstract = {Spatiotemporal gene expression programmes are orchestrated by
   transcriptional enhancers, which are key regulatory DNA elements that
   engage in physical contacts with their target-gene promoters, often
   bridging considerable genomic distances. Recent progress in genomics,
   genome editing and microscopy methodologies have enabled the genome-wide
   mapping of enhancer-promoter contacts and their functional dissection.
   In this Review, we discuss novel concepts on how enhancer-promoter

   mammalian genomes both facilitates and constrains enhancer-promoter
   contacts, and the role they play in gene expression control during
   normal development and disease.},

Journal = {CELLULAR AND MOLECULAR BIOENGINEERING},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {9},
Number = {2},
Pages = {258-267},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Dysmorphic nuclei are commonly seen in cancers and provide strong
   motivation for studying in various cancer contexts the main structural
   proteins of nuclei, the lamins. Past studies have separately
   demonstrated the importance of microenvironment mechanics to cancer
   progression, which is extremely interesting because the lamina was
   recently shown to be mechanosensitive. Here, we review current knowledge
   relating cancer progression to lamina biophysics and biology. Lamin
   levels can modulate cancer cell migration in 3D and thereby impact tumor
   growth, and lamins can also protect or not a cancer cell's genome. In
   addition, lamins can influence transcriptional regulators (RAR, SRF,
   YAP/TAZ) as well as chromosome conformation in lamina associated
   domains. Further investigation of the roles for lamins in cancer and
   even DNA damage may lead to new therapies or at least to a clearer
   understanding of lamins as bio-markers in cancer progression.},

Abstract = {Eukaryotic genomes possess an elaborate and dynamic higher-order
   structure within the limiting confines of the cell nucleus. Knowledge of
   the physical principles and the molecular machinery that govern the 3D

   Elegant microscopy and chromosome conformation capture techniques

Title = {Three-Dimensional Arrangement of Genes Involved in Lipid Metabolism in
   Nuclei of Porcine Adipocytes and Fibroblasts in Relation to Their
   Transcription Level},

Abstract = {The 3-dimensional arrangement of chromosomes and genes within a nuclear
   space is considered to represent the level of transcriptional
   regulation. Understanding how the nuclear architecture of adipocyte
   cells contributes to gene expression has become the subject of great
   interest in the context of obesity research. In this study we
   investigated nuclear positioning of 3 gene loci involved in lipid
   metabolism in the pig (Sus scrofa, SSC) which is considered as an
   important animal model for obesity in humans. We found that the position
   of the SCD gene in the 3-dimensional space of the cell nucleus is not
   correlated with transcriptional activity. The gene locus as well as
   chromosome territory SSC14 occupied the same peripheral location in
   adipocyte and fibroblast cells, in spite of the fact that their
   transcription level differs significantly between both cell types. For
   the 2 other investigated genes, i.e. ACACA and SREBF1 and their
   chromosome territory (SSC12), slightly different nuclear locations were
   found. They occupied intermediate nuclear positions in fibroblast
   nuclei, while in adipocytes they were positioned in the nuclear
   interior. The more internal location of these genes corresponds to
   increased transcription levels in fat cells. Our results confirm the
   non-random position of genes and chromosome territories in nuclei of
   adult porcine cells and indicate that relationship between transcription
   activity and gene positioning exists only for some but not all genes.

Abstract = {Mammalian cells frequently migrate through tight spaces during normal
   embryogenesis, wound healing, diapedesis, or in pathological situations
   such as metastasis. Nuclear size and shape are important factors in
   regulating the mechanical properties of cells during their migration
   through such tight spaces. At the onset of migratory behavior, cells
   often initiate the expression of vimentin, an intermediate filament
   protein that polymerizes into networks extending from a juxtanuclear
   cage to the cell periphery. However, the role of vimentin intermediate
   filaments (VIFs) in regulating nuclear shape and mechanics remains
   unknown. Here, we use wild-type and vimentin-null mouse embryonic
   fibroblasts to show that VIFs regulate nuclear shape and perinuclear
   stiffness, cell motility in 3D, and the ability of cells to resist large
   deformations. These changes increase nuclear rupture and activation of
   DNA damage repair mechanisms, which are rescued by exogenous
   reexpression of vimentin. Our findings show that VIFs provide mechanical
   support to protect the nucleus and genome during migration.},

Abstract = {Dosage compensation is the process by which transcript levels of the X
   chromosome are equalized with those of autosomes. Although diverse
   mechanisms of dosage compensation have evolved across species, these
   mechanisms all involve distinguishing the X chromosome from autosomes.
   Because one chromosome is singled out from other chromosomes for precise
   regulation, dosage compensation serves as an important model for
   understanding how specific cis-elements are identified within the highly
   compacted 3D genome to co-regulate thousands of genes. Recently,
   multiple genomic approaches have provided key insights into the
   mechanisms of dosage compensation, extending what we have learned from
   classical genetic studies. In the future, newer genomic approaches that
   require little starting material show great promise to provide an
   understanding of the heterogeneity of dosage compensation between cells
   and how it functions in nonmodel organisms.},

   complexes and specific lamins},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CELL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {220},

Month = {APR 5},
Abstract = {Nuclear lamin isoforms form fibrous meshworks associated with nuclear
   pore complexes (NPCs). Using datasets prepared from subpixel and
   segmentation analyses of 3D-structured illumination microscopy images of
   WT and lamin isoform knockout mouse embryo fibroblasts, we determined
   with high precision the spatial association of NPCs with specific lamin
   isoform fibers. These relationships are retained in the enlarged lamin
   meshworks of Lmna(-/-) and Lmnb1(-/-) fibroblast nuclei. Cryo-ET
   observations reveal that the lamin filaments composing the fibers
   contact the nucleoplasmic ring of NPCs. Knockdown of the ring-associated
   nucleoporin ELYS induces NPC clusters that exclude lamin A/C fibers but
   include LB1 and LB2 fibers. Knockdown of the nucleoporin TPR or NUP153
   alters the arrangement of lamin fibers and NPCs. Evidence that the
   number of NPCs is regulated by specific lamin isoforms is presented.
   Overall the results demonstrate that lamin isoforms and nucleoporins act
   together to maintain the normal organization of lamin meshworks and NPCs
   within the nuclear envelope.},

Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {14},
Number = {1},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {The centromere components cohesin, CENP-A, and centromeric DNA are
   essential for biorientation of sister chromatids on the mitotic spindle
   and accurate sister chromatid segregation. Insight into the 3D
   organization of centromere components would help resolve how centromeres
   function on the mitotic spindle. We use ChIP-seq and super-resolution
   microscopy with single particle averaging to examine the geometry of
   essential centromeric components on human chromosomes. Both modalities
   suggest cohesin is enriched at pericentromeric DNA. CENP-A localizes to
   a subset of the alpha-satellite DNA, with clusters separated by similar
   to 562 nm and a perpendicular intervening similar to 190 nM wide axis of
   cohesin in metaphase chromosomes. Differently sized alpha-satellite
   arrays achieve a similar core structure. Here we present a working model
   for a common core configuration of essential centromeric components that
   includes CENP-A nucleosomes, alpha-satellite DNA and pericentromeric
   cohesion. This configuration helps reconcile how centromeres function
   and serves as a foundation to add components of the chromosome
   segregation machinery.},

Volume = {64},

Abstract = {Mvo10b from the mesophilic archaeon Methanococcus voltae is a member of
   the Sac10b family which may play an important role in the organization
   and accessibility of genetic information in Archaea. Since Mvo10b is a
   DNA-binding protein as the other member in the Sac10b family, to obtain
   a recombinant Mvo10b requires an efficient and inexpensive expression
   and purification system for producing the protein free of nucleic acid
   contamination. Previously, the hyperthermophilic archaeal Ssh10b of the
   Sac10b family was successfully purified. However, the protocol adopted
   to purify Ssh10b is not appropriate for purifying the mesophilic Mvo10b.
   This study describes the successful expression and purification of the
   recombinant Mvo10b. The expression of recombinant Mvo10b was carried out
   in Escherichia coli, and the target protein was expressed in the soluble
   form. The protein was purified by polyethyleneimine (PEI) precipitation
   followed by nickel ion metal affinity chromatography. The purity of
   Mvo10b was checked to insure being free of nucleic acid contamination.
   The final protein yield is about 30 mg/l of LB culture. The ensemble of
   NMR and far-UV CD data shows that the purified Mvo10b has abundant
   regular secondary structures and is correctly folded, which may have
   similar 3D structure as its hyperthermophilic counterpart
   {[}P62A]Ssh10b. The developed protocol has potential application in the
   production of the other thermophilic and mesophilic proteins in the
   Sac10b family. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {SENIES: DNA Shape Enhanced Two-Layer Deep Learning Predictor for the
   Identification of Enhancers and Their Strength},

Abstract = {Identifying enhancers is a critical task in bioinformatics due to their
   primary role in regulating gene expression. For this reason, various
   computational algorithms devoted to enhancer identification have been
   put forward over the years. More features are extracted from the single
   DNA sequences to boost the performance. Nevertheless, DNA structural
   information is neglected, which is an essential factor affecting the
   binding preferences of transcription factors to regulatory elements like
   enhancers. Here, we propose SENIES, a DNA shape enhanced deep learning
   predictor, to identify enhancers and their strength. The predictor
   consists of two layers where the first layer is for enhancer and
   non-enhancer identification, and the second layer is for predicting the
   strength of enhancers. Apart from two common sequence-derived features
   (i.e., one-hot and k-mer), DNA shape is introduced to describe the 3D
   structures of DNA sequences. Performance comparison with
   state-of-the-art methods conducted on public datasets demonstrates the
   effectiveness and robustness of our predictor. The code implementation
   of SENIES is publicly available at https://github.com/hlju-liye/SENIES.},

Abstract = {The pathological consequences of structural variants disrupting 3D
   genome organization can be difficult to elucidate in vivo due to
   differences in gene dosage sensitivity between mice and humans. This is
   illustrated by branchiooculofacial syndrome (BOFS), a rare congenital
   disorder caused by heterozygous mutations within TFAP2A, a neural crest
   regulator for which humans, but not mice, are haploinsufficient. Here,
   we present a BOFS patient carrying a heterozygous inversion with one
   breakpoint located within a topologically associating domain (TAD)
   containing enhancers essential for TFAP2A expression in human neural
   crest cells (hNCCs). Using patient-specific hiPSCs, we show that,
   although the inversion shuffles the TFAP2A hNCC enhancers with novel
   genes within the same TAD, this does not result in enhancer adoption.
   Instead, the inversion disconnects one TFAP2A allele from its cognate
   enhancers, leading to monoallelic and haploinsufficient TFAP2A
   expression in patient hNCCs. Our work illustrates the power of hiPSC
   differentiation to unveil long-range pathomechanisms.},

   fundamental requirement for life. Encapsulins are self-assembling
   protein-based nanocompartments from the prokaryotic repertoire that
   present a highly attractive platform for intracellular
   compartmentalization of chemical reactions by design. Using
   single-molecule Forster resonance energy transfer and 3D-MINFLUX
   analysis, we analyze fluorescently labeled encapsulins on a
   single-molecule basis. Furthermore, by equipping these capsules with a
   synthetic ruthenium catalyst via covalent attachment to a non-native
   host protein, we are able to perform in vitro catalysis and go on to
   show that engineered encapsulins can be used as hosts for transition
   metal catalysis inside living cells in confined space.},

Abstract = {c-MYC controls more than 15\% of genes responsible for proliferation,
   differentiation, and cellular metabolism in pancreatic as well as other
   cancers making this transcription factor a prime target for treating
   patients. The transcriptome of 55 patient-derived xenografts show that
   30\% of them share an exacerbated expression profile of MYC
   transcriptional targets (MYC-high). This cohort is characterized by a
   high level of Ki67 staining, a lower differentiation state, and a
   shorter survival time compared to the MYC-low subgroup. To define
   classifier expression signature, we selected a group of 10 MYC target
   transcripts which expression is increased in the MYC-high group and six
   transcripts increased in the MYClow group. We validated the ability of
   these markers panel to identify MYC-high patient-derived xenografts from
   both: discovery and validation cohorts as well as primary cell cultures
   from the same patients. We then showed that cells from MYC-high patients
   are more sensitive to JQ1 treatment compared to MYC-low cells, in
   monolayer, 3D cultured spheroids and in vivo xenografted tumors, due to
   cell cycle arrest followed by apoptosis. Therefore, these results
   provide new markers and potentially novel therapeutic modalities for
   distinct subgroups of pancreatic tumors and may find application to the
   future management of these patients within the setting of individualized
   medicine clinics.},

Abstract = {The architecture of interphase chromosomes is important for the
   regulation of gene expression and genome maintenance. Chromosomes are
   linearly segmented into hundreds of domains with different protein
   compositions. Furthermore, the spatial organization of chromosomes is
   nonrandom and is characterized by many local and long-range contacts
   among genes and other sequence elements. A variety of genome-wide
   mapping techniques have made it possible to chart these properties at
   high resolution. Combined with microscopy and computational modeling,
   the results begin to yield a more coherent picture that integrates
   linear and three-dimensional (3D) views of chromosome organization in
   relation to gene regulation and other nuclear functions.},

Title = {Deep Learning Sequence Models for Transcriptional Regulation},
Journal = {ANNUAL REVIEW OF GENOMICS AND HUMAN GENETICS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {25},
Pages = {105-122},
Abstract = {Deciphering the regulatory code of gene expression and interpreting the
   transcriptional effects of genome variation are critical challenges in
   human genetics. Modern experimental technologies have resulted in an
   abundance of data, enabling the development of sequence-based deep
   learning models that link patterns embedded in DNA to the biochemical
   and regulatory properties contributing to transcriptional regulation,
   including modeling epigenetic marks, 3D genome organization, and gene
   expression, with tissue and cell-type specificity. Such methods can
   predict the functional consequences of any noncoding variant in the
   human genome, even rare or never-before-observed variants, and
   systematically characterize their consequences beyond what is tractable
   from experiments or quantitative genetics studies alone. Recently, the
   development and application of interpretability approaches have led to
   the identification of key sequence patterns contributing to the
   predicted tasks, providing insights into the underlying biological
   mechanisms learned and revealing opportunities for improvement in future
   models.},

Abstract = {Enhancers establish spatial or temporal patterns of gene expression that
   are critical for development, yet our understanding of how these DNA
   cis-regulatory elements function from a distance to increase
   transcription of their target genes and shape the cellular transcriptome
   has been gleaned primarily from studies of individual genes or gene
   families. High-throughput sequencing studies place enhancer-gene
   interactions within the 3D context of chromosome folding, inviting a new
   look at enhancer function and stimulating provocative new questions.
   Here, we integrate these whole-genome studies with recent mechanistic
   studies to illuminate how enhancers physically interact with target
   genes, how enhancer activity is regulated during development, and the
   role of noncoding RNAs transcribed from enhancers in their function.},

Title = {Involvement of condensin in cellular senescence through gene regulation
   and compartmental reorganization},
Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {10},
Month = {DEC 12},
Abstract = {Senescence is induced by various stimuli such as oncogene expression and
   telomere shortening, referred to as oncogene-induced senescence (OIS)
   and replicative senescence (RS), respectively, and accompanied by global
   transcriptional alterations and 3D genome reorganization. Here, we
   demonstrate that the human condensin II complex participates in
   senescence via gene regulation and reorganization of euchromatic A and
   heterochromatic B compartments. Both OIS and RS are accompanied by
   A-to-B and B-to-A compartmental transitions, the latter of which occur
   more frequently and are undergone by 14\% (430 Mb) of the human genome.
   Mechanistically, condensin is enriched in A compartments and implicated
   in B-to-A transitions. The full activation of senescence genes (SASP
   genes and p53 targets) requires condensin; its depletion impairs
   senescence markers. This study describes that condensin reinforces
   euchromatic A compartments and promotes B-to-A transitions, both of
   which are coupled to optimal expression of senescence genes, thereby
   allowing condensin to contribute to senescent processes.},

Abstract = {Genome rearrangements that occur during evolution impose major
   challenges on regulatory mechanisms that rely on three-dimensional
   genome architecture. Here, we developed a scaffolding algorithm and
   generated chromosome-length assemblies from Hi-C data for studying
   genome topology in three distantly related Drosophila species. We
   observe extensive genome shuffling between these species with one
   synteny breakpoint after approximately every six genes. A/B
   compartments, a set of large gene-dense topologically associating
   domains (TADs), and spatial contacts between high-affinity sites (HAS)
   located on the X chromosome are maintained over 40 million years,
   indicating architectural conservation at various hierarchies.
   Evolutionary conserved genes cluster in the vicinity of HAS, while HAS
   locations appear evolutionarily flexible, thus uncoupling functional
   requirement of dosage compensation from individual positions on the
   linear X chromosome. Therefore, 3D architecture is preserved even in
   scenarios of thousands of rearrangements highlighting its relevance for
   essential processes such as dosage compensation of the X chromosome.},

Abstract = {The connectivity patterns of neurons sustaining the functionality of
   spinal locomotor circuits rely on the specification of hundreds of motor
   neuron and interneuron subtypes precisely arrayed within the embryonic
   spinal cord. Knowledge acquired by developmental biologists on the
   molecular mechanisms underpinning this process in vivo has supported the
   development of 2D and 3D differentiation strategies to generate spinal
   neuronal diversity from mouse and human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs).
   Here, we review recent breakthroughs in this field and the perspectives
   opened up by models of in vitro embryogenesis to approach the mechanisms
   underlying neuronal diversification and the formation of functional
   mouse and human locomotor circuits. Beyond serving fundamental
   investigations, these new approaches should help engineering neuronal
   circuits differentially impacted in neuromuscular disorders, such as
   amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or spinal muscular atrophies, and thus
   open new avenues for disease modeling and drug screenings.},

Abstract = {SMARCB1 loss has long been observed in many solid tumors. However, there
   is a need to elucidate targetable pathways driving growth and metastasis
   in SMARCB1-deficient tumors. Here, we demonstrate that SMARCB1
   deficiency, defined as genomic SMARCB1 copy number loss associated with
   reduced mRNA, drives disease progression in patients with bladder cancer
   by engaging STAT3. SMARCB1 loss increases the chromatin accessibility of
   the STAT3 locus in vitro. Orthotopically implanted SMARCB1 knockout (KO)
   cell lines exhibit increased tumor growth and metastasis.
   SMARCB1-deficient tumors show an increased IL6/JAK/STAT3 signaling axis
   in in vivo models and patients. Furthermore, a pSTAT3 selective
   inhibitor, TTI-101, reduces tumor growth in SMARCB1 KO orthotopic cell
   line-derived xenografts and a SMARCB1-deficient patient derived
   xenograft model. We have identified a gene signature generated from
   SMARCB1 KO tumors that predicts SMARCB1 deficiency in patients. Overall,
   these findings support the clinical evaluation of STAT3 inhibitors for
   the treatment of SMARCB1-deficient bladder cancer.
   SMARCB1 is frequently lost in solid cancer and reported to support
   tumourigenesis through STAT3 activation. Here, the authors show in
   several preclinical models that targeting IL6/JAK/STAT3 molecular
   pathway is a potential therapeutic approach for SMARCB1-deficient
   bladder cancer.},

Title = {Deciphering the Gene Regulatory Landscape Encoded in DNA Biophysical
   Features},
Journal = {ISCIENCE},

Abstract = {Gene regulation in higher organisms involves a sophisticated interplay
   between genetic and epigenetic mechanisms. Despite advances, the logic
   in selective usage of certain genomic regions as regulatory elements
   remains unclear. Here we show that the inherent biophysical properties
   of the DNA encode epigenetic state and the underlying regulatory
   potential. We find that the propeller twist (ProT) level is indicative
   of genomic location of the regulatory elements, their strength, the
   affinity landscape of transcription factors, and distribution in the
   nuclear 3D space. We experimentally show that ProT levels confer
   increased DNA flexibility and surface accessibility, and thus
   potentially primes usage of high ProT regions as regulatory elements.
   ProT levels also correlate with occurrence and phenotypic consequences
   of mutations. Interestingly, cell-fate switches involve a transient
   usage of low ProT regulatory elements. Altogether, our work provides
   unprecedented insights into the gene regulatory landscape encoded in the
   DNA biophysical features.},

Abstract = {DNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is the technique of choice
   to map the position of genomic loci in three-dimensional (3D) space at
   the single allele level in the cell nucleus. High-throughput DNA FISH
   methods have recently been developed using complex libraries of
   fluorescently labeled synthetic oligonucleotides and automated
   fluorescence microscopy, enabling large-scale interrogation of genomic
   organization. Although the FISH signals generated by high-throughput
   methods can, in principle, be analyzed by traditional spot-detection
   algorithms, these approaches require user intervention to optimize each
   interrogated genomic locus, making analysis of tens or hundreds of
   genomic loci in a single experiment prohibitive. We report here the
   design and testing of two separate machine learning-based workflows for
   FISH signal detection in a high-throughput format. The two methods rely
   on random forest (RF) classification or convolutional neural networks
   (CNNs), respectively. Both workflows detect DNA FISH signals with high
   accuracy in three separate fluorescence microscopy channels for tens of
   independent genomic loci, without the need for manual parameter value
   setting on a per locus basis. In particular, the CNN workflow, which we
   named SpotLearn, is highly efficient and accurate in the detection of
   DNA FISH signals with low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). We suggest that
   SpotLearn will be useful to accurately and robustly detect diverse DNA
   FISH signals in a high-throughput fashion, enabling the visualization
   and positioning of hundreds of genomic loci in a single experiment.},

Journal = {ELIFE},

Volume = {8},
Month = {MAY 14},
Abstract = {Eukaryotic DNA is highly organized within nuclei and this organization
   is important for genome function. Fluorescent in situ hybridization
   (FISH) approaches allow 3D architectures of genomes to be visualized.
   Scalable FISH technologies, which can be applied to whole animals, are
   needed to help unravel how genomic architecture regulates, or is
   regulated by, gene expression during development, growth, reproduction,
   and aging. Here, we describe a multiplexed DNA FISH Oligopaint library
   that targets the entire Caenorhabditis elegans genome at chromosome,
   three megabase, and 500 kb scales. We describe a hybridization strategy
   that provides flexibility to DNA FISH experiments by coupling a single
   primary probe synthesis reaction to dye conjugated detection oligos via
   bridge oligos, eliminating the time and cost typically associated with
   labeling probe sets for individual experiments. The approach allows
   visualization of genome organization at varying scales in all/most cells
   across all stages of development in an intact animal model system.},

Title = {Lamin B1 mapping reveals the existence of dynamic and functional
   euchromatin lamin B1 domains},
Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {9},
Month = {AUG 24},
Abstract = {Lamins (A/C and B) are major constituents of the nuclear lamina (NL).
   Structurally conserved lamina-associated domains (LADs) are formed by
   genomic regions that contact the NL. Lamins are also found in the
   nucleoplasm, with a yet unknown function. Here we map the genome-wide
   localization of lamin B1 in an euchromatin-enriched fraction of the
   mouse genome and follow its dynamics during the
   epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Lamin B1 associates with
   actively expressed and open euchromatin regions, forming dynamic
   euchromatin lamin B1-associated domains (eLADs) of about 0.3 Mb. Hi-C
   data link eLADs to the 3D organization of the mouse genome during EMT
   and correlate lamin B1 enrichment at topologically associating domain
   (TAD) borders with increased border strength. Having reduced levels of
   lamin B1 alters the EMT transcriptional signature and compromises the
   acquisition of mesenchymal traits. Thus, during EMT, the process of
   genome reorganization in mouse involves dynamic changes in eLADs.},

Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2020},

Abstract = {The Ikzf1 locus encodes the lymphoid specific transcription factor
   Ikaros, which plays an essential role in both T and B cell
   differentiation, while deregulation or mutation of IKZF1/Ikzf1 is
   involved in leukemia. Tissue-specific and cell identity genes are
   usually associated with clusters of enhancers, also called
   super-enhancers, which are believed to ensure proper regulation of gene
   expression throughout cell development and differentiation. Several
   potential regulatory regions have been identified in close proximity of
   Ikzf1, however, the full extent of the regulatory landscape of the Ikzf1
   locus is not yet established. In this study, we combined epigenomics and
   transcription factor binding along with high-throughput enhancer assay
   and 4C-seq to prioritize an enhancer element located 120 kb upstream of
   the Ikzf1 gene. We found that deletion of the E120 enhancer resulted in
   a significant reduction of Ikzf1 mRNA. However, the epigenetic landscape
   and 3D topology of the locus were only slightly affected, highlighting
   the complexity of the regulatory landscape regulating the Ikzf1 locus.},

Abstract = {Undifferentiated human epidermal keratinocytes are self-renewing stem
   cells that can be induced to undergo a program of differentiation by
   varying the calcium chloride concentration in the culture media. We
   utilize this model of cell differentiation and a 3D chromosome painting
   technique to document significant changes in the radial arrangement,
   morphology, and interchromosomal associations between the gene poor
   chromosome 18 and the gene rich chromosome 19 territories at discrete
   stages during keratinocyte differentiation. We suggest that changes
   observed in chromosomal territorial organization provides an
   architectural basis for genomic function during cell differentiation and
   provide further support for a chromosome territory code that contributes
   to gene expression at the global level. J. Cell. Physiol. 221: 139-146,

Journal = {NATURE GENETICS},

Volume = {49},

Abstract = {Extensive prior research focused on somatic copy-number alterations
   (SCNAs) affecting cancer genes, yet the extent to which recurrent SCNAs
   exert their influence through rearrangement of cis-regulatory elements
   (CREs) remains unclear. Here we present a framework for inferring
   cancer-related gene overexpression resulting from CRE reorganization
   (e.g., enhancer hijacking) by integrating SCNAs, gene expression data
   and information on topologically associating domains (TADS). Analysis of
   7,416 cancer genomes uncovered several pan-cancer candidate genes,
   including IRS4, SMARCA1 and TERT. We demonstrate that IRS4
   overexpression in lung cancer is associated with recurrent deletions in
   cis, and we present evidence supporting a tumor promoting role. We
   additionally pursued cancer-type-specific analyses and uncovered IGF2 as
   a target for enhancer hijacking in colorectal cancer. Recurrent tandem
   duplications intersecting with a TAD boundary mediate de novo formation
   of a 3D contact domain comprising IGF2 and a lineage-specific
   super-enhancer, resulting in high-level gene activation. Our framework
   enables systematic inference of CRE rearrangements mediating
   dysregulation in cancer.},

Title = {DeepFoci: Deep learning-based algorithm for fast automatic analysis of
   DNA double-strand break ionizing radiation-induced foci},
Journal = {COMPUTATIONAL AND STRUCTURAL BIOTECHNOLOGY JOURNAL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {19},
Pages = {6465-6480},
Abstract = {DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), marked by ionizing radiation-induced
   (repair) foci (IRIFs), are the most serious DNA lesions and are
   dangerous to human health. IRIF quantification based on confocal
   microscopy represents the most sensitive and gold-standard method in
   radiation biodosimetry and allows research on DSB induction and repair
   at the molecular and single-cell levels. In this study, we introduce
   DeepFoci - a deep learning-based fully automatic method for IRIF
   counting and morphometric analysis. DeepFoci is designed to work with 3D
   multichannel data (trained for 53BP1 and gamma H2AX) and uses U-Net for
   nucleus segmentation and IRIF detection, together with maximally stable
   extremal region-based IRIF segmentation.
   The proposed method was trained and tested on challenging datasets
   consisting of mixtures of nonir-radiated and irradiated cells of
   different types and IRIF characteristics - permanent cell lines (NHDFs,
   U87) and primary cell cultures prepared from tumors and adjacent normal
   tissues of head and neck cancer patients. The cells were dosed with
   0.5-8 Gy-gamma-rays and fixed at multiple (0-24 h) postirradiation
   times. Under all circumstances, DeepFoci quantified the number of IRIFs
   with the highest accuracy among current advanced algorithms. Moreover,
   while the detection error of DeepFoci remained comparable to the
   variability between two experienced experts, the software maintained its
   sensitivity and fidelity across dramatically different IRIF counts per
   nucleus. In addition, information was extracted on IRIF 3D morphometric
   features and repair protein colocalization within IRIFs. This approach
   allowed multiparameter IRIF categorization of single- or multichannel
   data, thereby refining the analysis of DSB repair processes and
   classification of patient tumors, with the potential to identify
   specific cell subclones.
   The developed software improves IRIF quantification for various
   practical applications (radiotherapy monitoring, biodosimetry, etc.) and
   opens the door to advanced DSB focus analysis and, in turn, a better
   understanding of (radiation-induced) DNA damage and repair. (C) 2021 The

Title = {Asymmetric subgenome selection and <i>cis</i>-regulatory divergence
   during cotton domestication},

Abstract = {Comparative population genomics offers an excellent opportunity for
   unraveling the genetic history of crop domestication. Upland cotton
   (Gossypium hirsutum) has long been an important economic crop, but a
   genome-wide and evolutionary understanding of the effects of human
   selection is lacking. Here, we describe a variation map for 352 wild and
   domesticated cotton accessions. We scanned 93 domestication sweeps
   occupying 74 Mb of the A subgenome and 104 Mb of the D subgenome, and
   identified 19 candidate loci for fiber-quality-related traits through a
   genome-wide association study. We provide evidence showing asymmetric
   subgenome domestication for directional selection of long fibers. Global
   analyses of DNase I-hypersensitive sites and 3D genome architecture,
   linking functional variants to gene transcription, demonstrate the
   effects of domestication on cis-regulatory divergence. This study
   provides new insights into the evolution of gene organization,
   regulation and adaptation in a major crop, and should serve as a rich
   resource for genome-based cotton improvement.},

Abstract = {The epigenetic information present in mammalian gametes and whether it
   is transmitted to the progeny are relatively unknown. We find that many
   promoters in mouse sperm are occupied by RNA polymerase II (Pol II) and
   Mediator. The same promoters are accessible in GV and MII oocytes and
   preimplantation embryos. Sperm distal ATAC-seq sites containing motifs
   for various transcription factors are conserved in monkeys and humans.
   ChIP-seq analyses confirm that Foxa1, ER alpha, and AR occupy distal
   enhancers in sperm. Accessible sperm enhancers containing H3.3 and H2A.Z
   are also accessible in oocytes and preimplantation embryos. Furthermore,
   their interactions with promoters in the gametes persist during early
   development. Sperm-or oocyte-specific interactions mediated by CTCF and
   cohesin are only present in the paternal or maternal chromosomes,
   respectively, in the zygote and 2-cell stages. These interactions
   converge in both chromosomes by the 8-cell stage. Thus, mammalian
   gametes contain complex patterns of 3D interactions that can be
   transmitted to the zygote after fertilization.},

Abstract = {The regulation of gene expression has been studied for decades, but the
   underlying mechanisms are still not fully understood. As well as local
   and distant regulation, there are specific mechanisms of regulation
   during development and physiological modulation of gene activity in
   differentiated cells. Current research strongly supports a role for the
   3D chromosomal structure in the regulation of gene expression. However,
   it is not known whether the genome structure reflects the formation of
   active or repressed chromosomal domains or if these structures play a
   primary role in the regulation of gene expression. During early
   development, heterochromatinization of ribosomal DNA (rDNA) is coupled
   with silencing or activation of the expression of different sets of
   genes. Although the mechanisms behind this type of regulation are not
   known, rDNA clusters shape frequent inter-chromosomal contacts with a
   large group of genes controlling development. This review aims to shed
   light on the involvement of clusters of ribosomal genes in the global
   regulation of gene expression. We also discuss the possible role of
   RNA-mediated and phase-separation mechanisms in the global regulation of
   gene expression by nucleoli.},

Abstract = {DNA conformation in complex with proteins is far from its canonical
   B-form. The affinity of complex formation and structure of DNA depend on
   its attachment configuration and sequence. In this article, we develop a
   mechanical model to address the problem of DNA structure and energy
   under deformation. DNA in nucleosome core particle is described as an
   example. The structure and energy of nucleosomal DNA is calculated based
   on its sequence and positioning state. The inferred structure has
   remarkable similarity with X-ray data. Although there is no
   sequence-specific interaction of bases and the histone core, we found
   considerable sequence dependency for the nucleosomal DNA positioning.
   The affinity of nucleosome formation for several sequences is examined
   and the differences are compatible with observations. We argue that
   structural energy determines the natural state of nucleosomal DNA and is
   the main reason for affinity differences in vitro. This theory can be
   utilized for the DNA structure and energy determination in protein-DNA
   complexes in general.An animated Interactive 3D Complement (I3DC) is

Abstract = {Aims: The production of a homogenous population of human cardiomyocytes
   that can be expanded in vitro may facilitate development of replacement
   tissue lost as a result of cardiac disease and injury. Materials and
   methods: We evaluated the utility of activated leukocyte cell-adhesion
   molecule, CD166 (ALCAM) expression as a marker for isolating
   cardiomyocytes from differentiating cultures of human embryonic stem
   cells (hESCs). Using RT-qPCR, immunohistochemistry and DNA methylation
   studies, we evaluated the developmental age of hESC-derived
   cardiomyocytes. Results and conclusions: We demonstrate that
   cardiomyocytes derived from hESC cultures express ALCAM and that this
   surface antigen can be used to select a population of differentiated
   cells that are enriched for cardiomyocytes. Expression of contractile
   proteins and ion channels, and DNA methylation patterns, suggest that
   ALCAM-enriched cardiomyocytes have an embryonic phenotype. Selected
   cardiomyocyte populations survive sorting, adhere to collagen-coated
   tissue culture plastic and proliferate in short-term culture. Long-term
   in vitro survival of cardiomyocytes was achieved by culturing cells in
   3D aggregates.},

Abstract = {Multi-subunit RNA polymerases bind nucleotide triphosphate (NTP)
   substrates in the pretranslocated state and carry the dNMP-NTP base pair
   into the active site for phosphoryl transfer. NTP-driven translocation
   requires that NTP substrates enter the main-enzyme channel before
   loading into the active site. Based on this model, a new view of
   fidelity and efficiency of RNA synthesis is proposed. The model predicts
   that, during processive elongation, NTP-driven translocation is coupled
   to a protein conformational change that allows pyrophosphate release:
   coupling the end of one bond-addition cycle to substrate loading and
   translocation for the next. We present a detailed model of the RNA
   polymerase II elongation complex based on 2 low-affinity NTP binding
   sites located in the main-enzyme channel. This model posits that NTP
   substrates, elongation factors, and the conserved Rpb2 subunit fork loop
   2 cooperate to regulate opening of the downstream transcription bubble.},

Abstract = {The 3D spatial organization of the chromosomes appears to be linked to
   the gene function, which is cell type-specific. The chromosome
   structural ensemble switching model (CSESM) is developed by employing a
   heteropolymer model on different cell types and the important
   quantitative relationships among the chromosome ensemble, the epigenetic
   marks, and the gene expressions are uncovered, that both chromosome
   fluctuation and epigenetic marks have strong linear correlations with
   the gene expressions. The results support that the two compartments have
   different behaviors, corresponding to the relatively sparse and
   fluctuating phase (compartment A) and the relatively dense and stable
   phase (compartment B). Importantly, through the investigation of the
   transdifferentiation processes between the peripheral blood mononuclear
   cell (PBMC) and the bipolar neuron (BN), a quantitative description for
   the transdifferentiation is provided, which can be linked to the
   Waddington landscape. In addition, compared to the direct
   transdifferentiation between PBMC and BN, the transdifferentiation via
   the intermediate state neural progenitor cell (NPC) follows a different
   path (an ``uphill{''} followed by a ``downhill{''}). These theoretical
   studies bridge the gap among the chromosome fluctuations/ensembles, the
   epigenetics, and gene expressions in determining the cell fate.},

Abstract = {The spatial segregation of the genome into compartments is a major
   feature of 3D genome organization. New data on mammalian chromosome
   organization across different conditions reveal important information
   about how and why these compartments form and change. A combination of
   epigenetic state, nuclear body tethering, physical forces, gene
   expression, and replication timing (RT) can all influence the
   establishment and alteration of chromosome compartments. We review the
   causes and implications of genomic regions undergoing a `compartment
   switch' that changes their physical associations and spatial location in
   the nucleus. About 20-30\% of genomic regions change compartment during
   cell differentiation or cancer progression, whereas alterations in
   response to a stimulus within a cell type are usually much more limited.
   However, even a change in 1-2\% of genomic bins may have biologically
   relevant implications. Finally, we review the effects of compartment
   changes on gene regulation, DNA damage repair, replication, and the
   physical state of the cell.},

Abstract = {Transcriptional enhancers are regulatory DNAs that instruct when and
   where genes should be transcribed in response to a variety of intrinsic
   and external signals. They contain a cluster of binding sites for
   sequence-specific transcription factors and co-activators to determine
   the spatiotemporal specificity of gene activities during development.
   Enhancers are often positioned in distal locations from their target
   promoters. In some cases, they work over a million base pairs or more.
   In the traditional view, enhancers have been thought to stably interact
   with promoters in a targeted manner. However, quantitative imaging
   studies provide a far more dynamic picture of enhancer action. Moreover,
   recent Hi-C methods suggest that regulatory interactions are dynamically
   regulated by the higher-order chromosome topology. In this review, we
   summarize the emerging findings in the field and propose that assembly
   of ``transcription hubs{''} in the context of 3D genome structure plays
   an important role in transcriptional regulation.},

Journal = {MOLECULAR CELL},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {71},

Abstract = {Cells respond to temperature stress via up- and downregulation of
   hundreds of genes. This process is thought to be regulated by the heat
   shock factor HSF1, which controls the release of RNAPII from
   promoter-proximal pausing. Here, we analyze the events taking place in
   hESCs upstream of RNAPII release. We find that temperature stress
   results in the activation or decommissioning of thousands of enhancers.
   This process involves alterations in the occupancy of transcription
   factors HSF1, AP-1, NANOG, KLF4, and OCT4 accompanied by nucleosome
   remodeling by BRG1 and changes in H3K27ac. Furthermore, redistribution
   of RAD21 and CTCF results in the formation and disassembly of
   interactions mediated by these two proteins. These alterations tether

Title = {Senescent mesenchymal stem cells remodel extracellular matrix driving
   breast cancer cells to a more-invasive phenotype},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CELL SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {133},
Number = {2},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are essential for the regenerative
   process; however, biological aging and environmental stress can induce
   senescence - an irreversible state of growth arrest - that not only
   affects the behavior of cells but also disrupts their ability to restore
   tissue integrity. While abnormal tissue properties, including increased
   extracellular matrix stiffness, are linked with the risk of developing
   breast cancer, the role and contribution of senescent MSCs to the
   disease progression to malignancy are not well understood. Here, we
   investigated senescence-associated biophysical changes in MSCs and how
   this influences cancer cell behavior in a 3D matrix interface model.
   Although senescent MSCs were far less motile than pre-senescent MSCs,
   they induced an invasive breast cancer phenotype, characterized by
   increased spheroid growth and cell invasion in collagen gels. Further
   analysis of collagen gels using second-harmonic generation showed
   increased collagen density when senescent MSCs were present, suggesting
   that senescent MSCs actively remodel the surrounding matrix. This study
   provides direct evidence of the pro-malignant effects of senescent MSCs
   in tumors.},

Title = {Ndc1 drives nuclear pore complex assembly independent of membrane
   biogenesis to promote nuclear formation and growth},
Journal = {ELIFE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {11},
Month = {JUL 19},
Abstract = {The nuclear envelope (NE) assembles and grows from bilayer lipids
   produced at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). How ER membrane
   incorporation coordinates with assembly of nuclear pore complexes (NPCs)
   to generate a functional NE is not well understood. Here, we use the
   stereotypical first division of the early C. elegans embryo to test the
   role of the membrane-associated nucleoporin Ndc1 in coupling NPC
   assembly to NE formation and growth. 3D-EM tomography of reforming and
   expanded NEs establishes that Ndc1 determines NPC density. Loss of ndc1
   results in faster turnover of the outer scaffold nucleoporin Nup160 at
   the NE, providing an explanation for how Ndc1 controls NPC number. NE
   formation fails in the absence of both Ndc1 and the inner ring component
   Nup53, suggesting partially redundant roles in NPC assembly.
   Importantly, upregulation of membrane synthesis restored the slow rate
   of nuclear growth resulting from loss of ndc1 but not from loss of
   nup53. Thus, membrane biogenesis can be decoupled from Ndc1-mediated NPC
   assembly to promote nuclear growth. Together, our data suggest that Ndc1
   functions in parallel with Nup53 and membrane biogenesis to control NPC
   density and nuclear size.},

Journal = {CELL REPORTS},
Year = {2020},

Month = {JUL 21},
Abstract = {It is currently assumed that 3D chromosomal organization plays a central
   role in transcriptional control. However, depletion of cohesin and CTCF
   affects the steady-state levels of only a minority of transcripts. Here,
   we use high-resolution Capture Hi-C to interrogate the dynamics of
   chromosomal contacts of all annotated human gene promoters upon
   degradation of cohesin and CTCF. We show that a majority of
   promoter-anchored contacts are lost in these conditions, but many
   contacts with distinct properties are maintained, and some new ones are
   gained. The rewiring of contacts between promoters and active enhancers
   upon cohesin degradation associates with rapid changes in target gene
   transcription as detected by SLAM sequencing (SLAM-seq). These results
   provide a mechanistic explanation for the limited, but consistent,
   effects of cohesin and CTCF depletion on steady-state transcription and
   suggest the existence of both cohesin-dependent and -in-dependent
   mechanisms of enhancer-promoter pairing.},

Abstract = {Here, we report that in T47D breast cancer cells 50 pM progestin is
   sufficient to activate cell cycle entry and the progesterone gene
   expression program. At this concentration, equivalent to the
   progesterone blood levels found around the menopause, progesterone
   receptor (PR) binds only to 2800 genomic sites, which are accessible to
   ATAC cleavage prior to hormone exposure. These highly accessible sites
   (HAs) are surrounded by well-organized nucleosomes and exhibit breast
   enhancer features, including estrogen receptor alpha (ER alpha), higher
   FOXA1 and BRD4 (bromodomain containing 4) occupancy. Although HAs are
   enriched in RAD21 and CTCF, PR binding is the driving force for the most
   robust interactions with hormone-regulated genes. HAs show higher
   frequency of 3D contacts among themselves than with other PR binding
   sites, indicating colocalization in similar compartments. Gene
   regulation via HAs is independent of classical coregulators and
   ATP-activated remodelers, relying mainly on MAP kinase activation that
   enables PR nuclear engagement. HAs are also preferentially occupied by
   PR and ERa in breast cancer xenografts derived from MCF-7 cells as well
   as from patients, indicating their potential usefulness as targets for
   therapeutic intervention.},

   clustering are unknown. Here, we compare the spatial recruitment of HR
   factors upon double-stranded DNA breaks (DSBs) induced in human and
   mouse pericentromeric heterochromatin, which differ in their capacity to
   form clusters. We show that while DSBs increase the accessibility of
   human pericentromeric heterochromatin by disrupting HPla dimerization,
   mouse pericentromeric heterochromatin repeat clustering imposes a
   physical barrier that requires many layers of de-compaction to be
   accessed. Our results support a model in which the 3D organization of
   heterochromatin dictates the spatial activation of DNA repair pathways
   and is key to preventing the activation of HR within clustered repeats
   and the onset of chromosomal translocations.},

Abstract = {The expression of Sonic hedgehog (Shh) in mouse limb buds is regulated
   by a long-range enhancer 1 Mb upstream of the Shh promoter. We used
   3D-FISH and chromosome conformation capture assays to track changes at
   the Shh locus and found that long-range promoter-enhancer interactions
   are specific to limb bud tissues competent to express Shh. However, the
   Shh locus loops out from its chromosome territory only in the posterior
   limb bud (zone of polarizing activity or ZPA), where Shh expression is
   active. Notably, while Shh mRNA is detected throughout the ZPA,
   enhancer-promoter interactions and looping out were only observed in
   small fractions of ZPA cells. In situ detection of nascent Shh
   transcripts and unstable EGFP reporters revealed that active Shh
   transcription is likewise only seen in a small fraction of ZPA cells.
   These results suggest that chromosome conformation dynamics at the Shh
   locus allow transient pulses of Shh transcription.},

Abstract = {In this work, we report the identification of novel
   bromodomain-containing protein 9 (BRD9) binders through a virtual
   screening based on our developed 3D structure-based pharmacophore model.
   The in silico workflow here described led to the identification of a
   promising initial hit (1) featuring the
   1-ethyl-1H-pyrazolo{[}3,4-b]pyridine motif which represented an
   unexplored chemotype for the development of a new class of BRD9 ligands.
   The encouraging biophysical results achieved for compound 1 prompted us
   to explore further tailored structural modification around the C-4 and
   C-6 positions of the central core. Hence, the design and synthesis of a
   set of 19 derivatives (2-20) were performed to extensively investigate
   the chemical space of BRD9 binding site. Among them, four compounds (5,
   11, 12, and 19) stood out in biophysical assays as new valuable BRD9
   ligands featuring IC50 values in the low-micromolar range. Noteworthy, a
   promising antiproliferative activity was detected in vitro for compound
   5 on HeLa and A375 cancer cell line. The successful combination and
   application of in silico tools, chemical synthesis, and biological
   assays allowed to identify novel BRD9 binders and to expand the arsenal
   of promising chemical entities amenable to the recognition of this
   important epigenetic target.},

Abstract = {Transcription factors (TFs) influence cell fate by interpreting the
   regulatory DNA within a genome. TFs recognize DNA in a specific manner;
   the mechanisms underlying this specificity have been identified for many
   TFs based on 3D structures of protein DNA complexes. More recently,
   structural views have been complemented with data from high-throughput
   in vitro and in vivo explorations of the DNA-binding preferences of many
   TFs. Together, these approaches have greatly expanded our understanding
   of TF-DNA interactions. However, the mechanisms by which TFs select in
   vivo binding sites and alter gene expression remain unclear. Recent work
   has highlighted the many variables that influence TF-DNA binding, while
   demonstrating that a biophysical understanding of these many factors
   will be central to understanding TF-function.},

Abstract = {The 3D organization of our genome is an important determinant for the
   transcriptional output of a gene in (patho)physiological contexts. The
   spatial organization of linear chromosomes within nucleus is dominantly
   inferred using two distinct approaches, chromosome conformation capture
   (3C) and DNA fluorescent in situ hybridization (DNA-FISH). While 3C and
   its derivatives score genomic interaction frequencies based on proximity
   ligation events, DNA-FISH methods measure physical distances between
   genomic loci. Despite these approaches probe different characteristics
   of chromosomal topologies, they provide a coherent picture of how
   chromosomes are organized in higher-order structures encompassing
   chromosome territories, compartments, and topologically associating
   domains. Yet, at the finer topological level of promoter-enhancer
   communication, the imaging-centered and the 3C methods give more
   divergent and sometimes seemingly paradoxical results. Here, we compare
   and contrast observations made applying visual DNA-FISH and molecular 3C
   approaches. We emphasize that the 3C approach, due to its inherently
   competitive ligation step, measures only `relative' proximities. A 3C
   interaction enriched between loci, therefore does not necessarily
   translates into a decrease in absolute spatial distance. Hence, we
   advocate caution when modeling chromosome conformations.},

Abstract = {The temporal order of DNA replication (replication timing {[}RT]) is
   highly coupled with genome architecture, but cis-elements regulating
   either remain elusive. We created a series of CRISPR-mediated deletions
   and inversions of a pluripotency-associated topologically associating
   domain (TAD) in mouse ESCs. CTCF-associated domain boundaries were
   dispensable for RT. CTCF protein depletion weakened most TAD boundaries
   but had no effect on RT or A/B compartmentalization genome-wide. By
   contrast, deletion of three intra-TAD CTCF-independent 3D contact sites
   caused a domain-wide early to-late RT shift, an A-to-B compartment
   switch, weakening of TAD architecture, and loss of transcription. The
   dispensability of TAD boundaries and the necessity of these ``early
   replication control elements{''} (ERCEs) was validated by deletions and
   inversions at additional domains. Our results demonstrate that discrete
   cis-regulatory elements orchestrate domain-wide RT, NB
   compartmentalization, TAD architecture, and transcription, revealing
   fundamental principles linking genome structure and function.},

Title = {Topologically associating domains are ancient features that coincide
   with Metazoan clusters of extreme noncoding conservation},
Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {8},
Month = {SEP 5},
Abstract = {Developmental genes in metazoan genomes are surrounded by dense clusters
   of conserved noncoding elements (CNEs). CNEs exhibit unexplained extreme
   levels of sequence conservation, with many acting as developmental
   long-range enhancers. Clusters of CNEs define the span of regulatory
   inputs for many important developmental regulators and have been
   described previously as genomic regulatory blocks (GRBs). Their function
   and distribution around important regulatory genes raises the question
   of how they relate to 3D conformation of these loci. Here, we show that
   clusters of CNEs strongly coincide with topological organisation,
   predicting the boundaries of hundreds of topologically associating
   domains (TADs) in human and Drosophila. The set of TADs that are
   associated with high levels of noncoding conservation exhibit distinct
   properties compared to TADs devoid of extreme noncoding conservation.
   The close correspondence between extreme noncoding conservation and TADs
   suggests that these TADs are ancient, revealing a regulatory
   architecture conserved over hundreds of millions of years.},

Abstract = {Before zygotic genome activation (ZGA), the quiescent genome undergoes
   reprogramming to transition into the transcriptionally active state.
   However, the mechanisms underlying euchromatin establishment during
   early embryogenesis remain poorly understood. Here, we show that histone
   H4 lysine 16 acetylation (H4K16ac) is maintained from oocytes to
   fertilized embryos in Drosophila and mammals. H4K16ac forms large
   domains that control nucleosome accessibility of promoters prior to ZGA
   in flies. Maternal depletion of MOF acetyltransferase leading to H4K16ac
   loss causes aberrant RNA Pol II recruitment, compromises the 3D
   organization of the active genomic compartments during ZGA, and causes
   downregulation of post-zygotically expressed genes. Germline depletion
   of histone deacetylases revealed that other acetyl marks cannot
   compensate for H4K16ac loss in the oocyte. Moreover, zygotic
   re-expression of MOF was neither able to restore embryonic viability nor
   onset of X chromosome dosage compensation. Thus, maternal H4K16ac
   provides an instructive function to the offspring, priming future gene
   activation.},

Abstract = {Cells integrate physicochemical signals on the nanoscale from the local
   microenvironment, resulting in altered functional nuclear landscape and
   gene expression. These alterations regulate diverse biological processes
   including stem cell differentiation, establishing robust developmental
   genetic programs and cellular homeostatic control systems. The
   mechanisms by which these signals are integrated into the 3D
   spatiotemporal organization of the cell nucleus to elicit differential
   gene expression programs are poorly understood. In this review I analyze
   our current understanding of mechanosignal transduction mechanisms to
   the cell nucleus to induce differential gene regulation. A description
   of both physical and chemical coupling, resulting in a prestressed
   nuclear organization, is emphasized. I also highlight the importance of
   spatial dimension in chromosome assembly, as well as the temporal
   filtering and stochastic processes at gene promoters that may be
   important in understanding the biophysical design principles underlying
   mechanoregulation of gene transcription.},

Title = {L1 retrotransposition in neurons is modulated by MeCP2},
Journal = {NATURE},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {468},
Number = {7322},
Pages = {443-446},
Month = {NOV 18},
Abstract = {Long interspersed nuclear elements-1 (LINE-1 or L1s) are abundant
   retrotransposons that comprise approximately 20\% of mammalian
   genomes(1-3). Active L1 retrotransposons can impact the genome in a
   variety of ways, creating insertions, deletions, new splice sites or
   gene expression fine-tuning(4-6). We have shown previously that L1
   retrotransposons are capable of mobilization in neuronal progenitor
   cells from rodents and humans and evidence of massive L1 insertions was
   observed in adult brain tissues but not in other somatic tissues(7,8).
   In addition, L1 mobility in the adult hippocampus can be influenced by
   the environment(9). The neuronal specificity of somatic L1
   retrotransposition in neural progenitors is partially due to the
   transition of a Sox2/HDAC1 repressor complex to a Wnt-mediated T-cell
   factor/lymphoid enhancer factor (TCF/LEF) transcriptional
   activator(7,10). The transcriptional switch accompanies chromatin
   remodelling during neuronal differentiation, allowing a transient
   stimulation of L1 transcription(7). The activity of L1 retrotransposons
   during brain development can have an impact on gene expression and
   neuronal function, thereby increasing brain-specific genetic
   mosaicism(11,12). Further understanding of the molecular mechanisms that
   regulate L1 expression should provide new insights into the role of L1
   retrotransposition during brain development. Here we show that L1
   neuronal transcription and retrotransposition in rodents are increased
   in the absence of methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2), a protein
   involved in global DNA methylation and human neurodevelopmental
   diseases. Using neuronal progenitor cells derived from human induced
   pluripotent stem cells and human tissues, we revealed that patients with
   Rett syndrome (RTT), carrying MeCP2 mutations, have increased
   susceptibility for L1 retrotransposition. Our data demonstrate that L1
   retrotransposition can be controlled in a tissue-specific manner and
   that disease-related genetic mutations can influence the frequency of
   neuronal L1 retrotransposition. Our findings add a new level of
   complexity to the molecular events that can lead to neurological
   disorders.},

Abstract = {Interphase chromosomes are organized into discrete chromosome
   territories (CTs) that may occupy preferred sub-nuclear positions. While
   chromosome size and gene density appear to influence positioning, the
   biophysical mechanisms behind CT localization, especially the
   relationship between morphology and positioning, remain obscure. One
   reason for this has been the difficulty in imaging, segmenting, and
   analyzing structures with variable or imprecise boundaries. This
   prompted us to develop a novel approach, based on the two-dimensional
   (2D) wavelet-transform modulus maxima (WTMM) method, adapted to perform
   objective and rigorous CT segmentation from nuclear background. The
   wavelet transform acts as a mathematical microscope to characterize
   spatial image information over a continuous range of size scales. This
   multiresolution nature, combined with full objectivity of the formalism,
   makes it more accurate than intensity-based segmentation algorithms and
   more appropriate than manual intervention. Using the WTMM method in
   combination with numerical simulation models, we show that CTs have a
   highly nonspherical 3D morphology, that CT positioning is nonrandom, and
   favors heterologous CT groupings. We discuss potential relationships
   between morphology, positioning, chromosomal function, and instability.},

Abstract = {Chromosome architecture and assorted nuclear compartments play an
   essential role in RNA transcription and processing. Growing vertebrate
   oocytes represent an advantageous model to study the principles of
   nuclear structure and function. In this article, the data on
   three-dimensional (3D) organisation of intact and non-deformed oocyte
   nuclei (germinal vesicles) in four species of birds (domestic chicken,
   Japanese quail, rock pigeon and chaffinch) obtained by confocal laser
   scanning microscopy are presented. The nucleus of the growing avian
   oocyte has an unusual structure of RNA processing machinery. Germinal
   vesicles from any of the avian species studied, with the exception of
   the rock pigeon, are characterized by absence of extrachromosomal
   RNA-enriched nuclear bodies including Cajal bodies, histone locus bodies
   and interchromatin granule clusters. The absence of Cajal bodies and
   histone locus bodies in chicken oocytes correlated with the inactivation
   of nucleolus organizer and clustered histone genes. Splicing factors
   such as SR-protein SC35 accumulated in chromosome-associated domains
   that were classified as complex loops (terminal giant and lumpy loops).
   Formation of such depot in avian oocyte nuclei is supposed to be
   nucleated by transcripts of non-coding tandem repeats. The results
   obtained strongly support a model of RNA-mediated nuclear domains
   formation.},

Abstract = {Protein lysine methyltransferase G9a is widely considered as an
   appealing antineoplastic target. Herein we present an integrated
   workflow combining shape-based virtual screening and structure-based
   molecular modification for the identification of novel G9a inhibitors.
   The shape-based similarity screening through ROCS overlay on the basis
   of the structure of UNC0638 was performed to identify CPUY074001
   contained a 6H-anthra{[}1,9-cdlisoxazol-6-one scaffold as a hit.
   Analysis of the binding mode of CPUY074001 with G9a and 3D-QSAR results,
   two series compounds were designed and synthesized. The derivatives were
   confirmed to be active by in vitro assay and the SAR was explored by
   docking stimulations. Besides, several analogues showed acceptable
   anti-proliferative effects against several cancer cell lines. Among
   them, CPUY074020 displayed potent dual G9a inhibitory activity and
   anti-proliferative activity. Furthermore, CPUY074020 induced cell
   apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner and displayed a significant
   decrease in dimethylation of H3K9. Simultaneously, CPUY074020 showed
   reasonable in vivo PK properties. Altogether, our workflow supplied a
   high efficient strategy in the identification of novel G9a inhibitors.
   Compounds reported here can serve as promising leads for further study.

   separation properties},
Journal = {LIFE SCIENCE ALLIANCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {5},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Mounting evidence implicates liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), the
   condensation of biomolecules into liquid-like droplets in the formation
   and dissolution of membraneless intracellular organelles (MLOs). Cells
   use MLOs or condensates for various biological processes, including
   emergency signaling and spatiotemporal control over steady-state
   biochemical reactions and heterochromatin formation. Insulator proteins
   are architectural elements involved in establishing independent domains
   of transcriptional activity within eukaryotic genomes. In Drosophila,
   insulator proteins form nuclear foci known as insulator bodies in
   response to osmotic stress. However, the mechanism through which
   insulator proteins assemble into bodies is yet to be investigated. Here,
   we identify signatures of LLPS by insulator bodies, including high
   disorder tendency in insulator proteins, scaffold-client-dependent
   assembly, extensive fusion behavior, sphericity, and sensitivity to
   1,6-hexanediol. We also show that the cohesin subunit Rad21 is a
   component of insulator bodies, adding to the known insulator protein
   constituents and gamma H2Av. Our data suggest a concerted role of
   cohesin and insulator proteins in insulator body formation and under
   physiological conditions. We propose a mechanism wherebythese
   architectural proteins modulate 3D genome organization through LLPS.},

Title = {PAR-TERRA directs homologous sex chromosome pairing},
Journal = {NATURE STRUCTURAL \& MOLECULAR BIOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {24},
Number = {8},
Pages = {620+},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {In mammals, homologous chromosomes rarely pair outside meiosis. One
   exception is the X chromosome, which transiently pairs during
   X-chromosome inactivation (XCI). How two chromosomes find each other in
   3D space is not known. Here, we reveal a required interaction between
   the X-inactivation center (Xic) and the telomere in mouse embryonic stem
   (ES) cells. The subtelomeric, pseudoautosomal regions (PARs) of the two
   sex chromosomes (X and Y) also undergo pairing in both female and male
   cells. PARs transcribe a class of telomeric RNA, dubbed PAR-TERRA, which
   accounts for a vast majority of all TERRA transcripts. PAR-TERRA binds
   throughout the genome, including to the PAR and Xic. During X-chromosome
   pairing, PAR-TERRA anchors the Xic to the PAR, creating a `tetrad' of
   pairwise homologous interactions (Xic-Xic, PAR-PAR, and Xic-PAR). Xic
   pairing occurs within the tetrad. Depleting PAR-TERRA abrogates pairing
   and blocks initiation of XCI, whereas autosomal PAR-TERRA induces
   ectopic pairing. We propose a `constrained diffusion model' in which
   PAR-TERRA creates an interaction hub to guide Xic homology searching
   during XCI.},

Title = {SRSF3 maintains transcriptome integrity in oocytes by regulation of
   alternative splicing and transposable elements},
Journal = {CELL DISCOVERY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {4},
Month = {JUN 19},
Abstract = {The RNA-binding protein SRSF3 (also known as SRp20) has critical roles
   in the regulation of pre-mRNA splicing. Zygotic knockout of Srsf3
   results in embryo arrest at the blastocyst stage. However, SRSF3 is also
   present in oocytes, suggesting that it might be critical as a maternally
   inherited factor. Here we identify SRSF3 as an essential regulator of
   alternative splicing and of transposable elements to maintain
   transcriptome integrity in mouse oocyte. Using 3D time-lapse confocal
   live imaging, we show that conditional deletion of Srsf3 in fully grown
   germinal vesicle oocytes substantially compromises the capacity of
   germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD), and consequently entry into meiosis.
   By combining single cell RNA-seq, and oocyte micromanipulation with
   steric blocking antisense oligonucleotides and RNAse-H inducing gapmers,
   we found that the GVBD defect in mutant oocytes is due to both aberrant
   alternative splicing and derepression of B2 SINE transposable elements.
   Together, our study highlights how control of transcriptional identity
   of the maternal transcriptome by the RNA-binding protein SRSF3 is
   essential to the development of fertilized-competent oocytes.},

Abstract = {TFIIIB and TFIIIC are multi-subunit factors required for transcription
   by RNA polymerase III. We present a genome-wide high-resolution
   footprint map of TFIIIB-TFIIIC complexes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae,
   obtained by paired-end sequencing of micrococcal nuclease-resistant DNA.
   On tRNA genes, TFIIIB and TFIIIC form stable complexes with the same
   distinctive occupancy pattern but in mirror image, termed `bootprints'.
   Global analysis reveals that the TFIIIB-TFIIIC transcription complex
   exhibits remarkable structural elasticity: tRNA genes vary significantly
   in length but remain protected by TFIIIC. Introns, when present, are
   markedly less protected. The RNA polymerase III transcription terminator
   is flexibly accommodated within the transcription complex and,
   unexpectedly, plays a major structural role by delimiting its
   3'-boundary. The ETC sites, where TFIIIC binds without TFIIIB, exhibit
   different bootprints, suggesting that TFIIIC forms complexes involving
   other factors. We confirm six ETC sites and report a new site (ETC10).
   Surprisingly, TFIIIC, but not TFIIIB, interacts with some centromeric
   nucleosomes, suggesting that interactions between TFIIIC and the
   centromere may be important in the 3D organization of the nucleus.},

Title = {Deciphering the molecular mechanism of the cancer formation by
   chromosome structural dynamics},
Journal = {PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {17},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Author summaryCancer is among the leading causes of human death. Cancer
   is regulated by the underlying regulatory network of gene expressions,
   which are in intimate relation to the 3D chromosome architectures.
   Numerous efforts have been spent on elucidating the chromosome
   structural variants in tumorigenesis, while the dynamical picture of how
   chromosomes structurally evolve during cancer formation is still
   missing. Here we integrate the Hi-C data into the polymer simulations to
   build the chromosome structural ensembles in the normal and cancer
   cells. Then we use a nonequilibrium landscape-switching model to
   simulate the chromosome structural dynamics during the cancerization and
   reversion processes. With quantified pathways, we show that the
   chromosomes at transient intermediate states in the cancer formation
   possess a significant degree of structural similarity to those at the
   stem cell. Our findings indicate the formation of stem-like states
   during cancer formation from the chromosome structural perspective. We
   draw a molecular-scale picture of the cancer formation, which contains
   initial reprogramming towards the stem cell followed by differentiation
   towards the cancer cell.
   Cancer reflects the dysregulation of the underlying gene network, which
   is strongly related to the 3D genome organization. Numerous efforts have
   been spent on experimental characterizations of the structural
   alterations in cancer genomes. However, there is still a lack of genomic
   structural-level understanding of the temporal dynamics for cancer
   initiation and progression. Here, we use a landscape-switching model to
   investigate the chromosome structural transition during the
   cancerization and reversion processes. We find that the chromosome
   undergoes a non-monotonic structural shape-changing pathway with initial
   expansion followed by compaction during both of these processes.
   Furthermore, our analysis reveals that the chromosome with a more
   expanding structure than those at both the normal and cancer cell during
   cancerization exhibits a sparse contact pattern, which shows significant
   structural similarity to the one at the embryonic stem cell in many
   aspects, including the trend of contact probability declining with the
   genomic distance, the global structural shape geometry and the spatial
   distribution of loci on the chromosome. In light of the intimate
   structure-function relationship at the chromosomal level, we further
   describe the cell state transition processes by the chromosome
   structural changes, suggesting an elevated cell stemness during the
   formation of the cancer cells. We show that cell cancerization and
   reversion are highly irreversible processes in terms of the chromosome
   structural transition pathways, spatial repositioning of chromosomal
   loci and hysteresis loop of contact evolution analysis. Our model draws
   a molecular-scale picture of cell cancerization from the chromosome
   structural perspective. The process contains initial reprogramming
   towards the stem cell followed by the differentiation towards the cancer
   cell, accompanied by an initial increase and subsequent decrease of the
   cell stemness.},

Abstract = {IntroductionHistone deacetylases (HDACs) are a class of zinc-dependent
   enzymes. They maintain acetylation homeostasis, with numerous biological
   functions and are associated with many diseases. HDAC3 strictly requires
   multi-subunit complex formation for activity. It is associated with the
   progression of numerous non-communicable diseases. Its widespread
   involvement in diseases makes it an epigenetic drug target. Preexisting
   HDAC3 inhibitors have many uses, highlighting the need for continued
   research in the discovery of HDAC3-selective inhibitors.Area coveredThis
   review provides an overview of 24 patents published from 2010 to 2023,
   focusing on compounds that inhibit the HDAC3 isoenzyme.Expert
   opinionHDAC3-selective inhibitors - pivotal for pharmacological
   applications, as single or combination therapies - are gaining traction
   as a strategy to move away from complications laden pan-HDAC inhibitors.
   Moreover, there is an unmet need for HDAC3 inhibitors with alternative
   zinc-binding groups (ZBGs) because some preexisting ZBGs have
   limitations related to toxicity and side effects. Difficulties in
   achieving HDAC3 selectivity may be due to isoform selectivity. However,
   advancements in computer-aided drug design and experimental data of
   HDAC3 3D co-crystallized models could lead to the discovery of novel
   HDAC3-selective inhibitors, which bear alternative ZBGs with balanced
   selectivity for HDAC3 and potency.},

Abstract = {Drug-combination data portals have recently been introduced to mine huge
   amounts of pharmacological data with the aim of improving current
   chemotherapy strategies. However, these portals have only been
   investigated for isolated datasets, and molecular profiles of cancer
   cell lines are lacking. Here we developed a cloud-based pharmacogenomics
   portal called SYNERGxDB (http://SYNERGxDB.ca/) that integrates multiple
   high-throughput drug-combination studies with molecular and
   pharmacological profiles of a large panel of cancer cell lines. This
   portal enables the identification of synergistic drug combinations
   through harmonization and unified computational analysis. We integrated
   nine of the largest drug combination datasets from both academic groups
   and pharmaceutical companies, resulting in 22 507 unique drug
   combinations (1977 unique compounds) screened against 151 cancer cell
   lines. This data compendium includes metabolomics, gene expression, copy
   number and mutation profiles of the cancer cell lines. In addition,
   SYNERGxDB provides analytical tools to discover effective therapeutic
   combinations and predictive biomarkers across cancer, including specific
   types. Combining molecular and pharmacological profiles, we
   systematically explored the large space of univariate predictors of drug
   synergism. SYNERGxDB constitutes a comprehensive resource that opens new
   avenues of research for exploring the mechanism of action for drug
   synergy with the potential of identifying new treatment strategies for

Abstract = {Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been implicated in normal cellular
   homeostasis as well as pathophysiological conditions, including cancer.
   Here we performed global gene expression profiling of mammary epithelial
   cells transformed by oncogenic v-Src, and identified a large subset of
   uncharacterized lncRNAs potentially involved in breast cancer
   development. Specifically, our analysis revealed a novel lncRNA,
   LINC00520 that is upregulated upon ectopic expression of oncogenic
   v-Src, in a manner that is dependent on the transcription factor STAT3.
   Similarly, LINC00520 is also increased in mammary epithelial cells
   transformed by oncogenic PI3K and its expression is decreased upon
   knockdown of mutant PIK3CA. Additional expression profiling highlight
   that LINC00520 is elevated in a subset of human breast carcinomas, with
   preferential enrichment in the basal-like molecular subtype.
   ShRNA-mediated depletion of LINC00520 results in decreased cell
   migration and loss of invasive structures in 3D. RNA sequencing analysis
   uncovers several genes that are differentially expressed upon ectopic
   expression of LINC00520, a significant subset of which are also induced
   in v-Src-transformed MCF10A cells. Together, these findings characterize
   LINC00520 as a lncRNA that is regulated by oncogenic Src, PIK3CA and
   STAT3, and which may contribute to the molecular etiology of breast
   cancer.},

Abstract = {While it has been long recognized that genes are not randomly positioned
   along the genome, the degree to which its 3D structure influences the
   arrangement of genes has remained elusive. In particular, several lines
   of evidence suggest that actively transcribed genes are spatially
   co-localized, forming transcription factories; however, a generalized
   systematic test has hitherto not been described. Here we reveal
   transcription factories using a rigorous definition of genomic structure
   based on Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome conformation capture data,
   coupled with an experimental design controlling for the primary gene
   order. We develop a data-driven method for the interpolation and the
   embedding of such datasets and introduce statistics that enable the
   comparison of the spatial and genomic densities of genes. Combining
   these, we report evidence that co-regulated genes are clustered in
   space, beyond their observed clustering in the context of gene order
   along the genome and show this phenomenon is significant for 64 out of
   117 transcription factors. Furthermore, we show that those transcription
   factors with high spatially co-localized targets are expressed higher

Title = {The Expression of Tubulin Cofactor A (TBCA) Is Regulated by a Noncoding
   Antisense <i>Tbca</i> RNA during Testis Maturation},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {7},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG 6},
Abstract = {Background: Recently, long noncoding RNAs have emerged as pivotal
   molecules for the regulation of coding genes' expression. These
   molecules might result from antisense transcription of functional genes
   originating natural antisense transcripts (NATs) or from transcriptional
   active pseudogenes. TBCA interacts with beta-tubulin and is involved in
   the folding and dimerization of new tubulin heterodimers, the building
   blocks of microtubules.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: We found that the mouse genome contains
   two structurally distinct Tbca genes located in chromosomes 13 (Tbca13)
   and 16 (Tbca16). Interestingly, the two Tbca genes albeit ubiquitously
   expressed, present differential expression during mouse testis
   maturation. In fact, as testis maturation progresses Tbca13 mRNA levels
   increase progressively, while Tbca16 mRNA levels decrease. This suggests
   a regulatory mechanism between the two genes and prompted us to
   investigate the presence of the two proteins. However, using tandem mass
   spectrometry we were unable to identify the TBCA16 protein in testis
   extracts even in those corresponding to the maturation step with the
   highest levels of Tbca16 transcripts. These puzzling results led us to
   re-analyze the expression of Tbca16. We then detected that Tbca16
   transcription produces sense and natural antisense transcripts.
   Strikingly, the specific depletion by RNAi of these transcripts leads to
   an increase of Tbca13 transcript levels in a mouse spermatocyte cell
   line.
   Conclusions/Significance: Our results demonstrate that Tbca13 mRNA
   levels are post-transcriptionally regulated by the sense and natural
   antisense Tbca16 mRNA levels. We propose that this regulatory mechanism
   operates during spermatogenesis, a process that involves microtubule
   rearrangements, the assembly of specific microtubule structures and
   requires critical TBCA levels.},

Abstract = {Expression of Hox genes located on different chromosomes is precisely
   regulated and synchronized during development. In order to test the
   hypothesis that the Hox loci might cluster in nuclear space in order to
   share regulatory components, we performed 3D FISH on cryosections of
   developing mouse embryos and differentiating embryoid bodies. We did not
   observe any instances of co-localization of 4 different Hox alleles.
   instances of 2 different alleles touching each other were found in
   20-47\% of nuclei depending on the tissue. The frequency of such
   ``kissing{''} events was not significantly different in cells expressing
   a high proportion of the Hox clusters when compared to cells expressing
   none or only a few Hox genes. We found that the HoxB and HoxC clusters,
   which are located in gene-rich regions, were involved more frequently in
   gene kissing in embryonic nuclei. In the case of HoxB, this observation
   correlated with the positioning of the corresponding chromosome towards
   the interior of the nucleus. Our results indicate that co-regulation of
   the different Hox clusters is not associated with co-localization of the
   loci at a single regulatory compartment and that the chromosomal context
   may influence the extent to which they contact each other in the
   nucleus. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {The three-dimensional genome organization of Drosophila melanogaster
   through data integration},
Journal = {GENOME BIOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {18},
Month = {JUL 31},
Abstract = {Background: Genome structures are dynamic and non-randomly organized in
   the nucleus of higher eukaryotes. To maximize the accuracy and coverage
   of three-dimensional genome structural models, it is important to
   integrate all available sources of experimental information about a
   genome's organization. It remains a major challenge to integrate such
   data from various complementary experimental methods. Here, we present
   an approach for data integration to determine a population of complete
   three-dimensional genome structures that are statistically consistent
   with data from both genome-wide chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C)
   and lamina-DamID experiments.
   Results: Our structures resolve the genome at the resolution of
   topological domains, and reproduce simultaneously both sets of
   experimental data. Importantly, this data deconvolution framework allows
   for structural heterogeneity between cells, and hence accounts for the
   expected plasticity of genome structures. As a case study we choose
   Drosophila melanogaster embryonic cells, for which both data types are
   available. Our three-dimensional genome structures have strong
   predictive power for structural features not directly visible in the
   initial data sets, and reproduce experimental hallmarks of the D.
   melanogaster genome organization from independent and our own imaging
   experiments. Also they reveal a number of new insights about genome
   organization and its functional relevance, including the preferred
   locations of heterochromatic satellites of different chromosomes, and
   observations about homologous pairing that cannot be directly observed
   in the original Hi-C or lamina-DamID data.
   Conclusions: Our approach allows systematic integration of Hi-C and
   lamina-DamID data for complete three-dimensional genome structure
   calculation, while also explicitly considering genome structural
   variability.},

Journal = {EXPERIMENTAL CELL RESEARCH},
Year = {2002},
Volume = {272},
Number = {2},
Pages = {163-175},
Month = {JAN 15},
Abstract = {The epidermal differentiation complex (EDC) at 1q21 is host to many
   structurally and functionally related genes coding for proteins involved
   in the differentiation process of keratinocytes. The grouping together
   of these genes which share spatial and temporal expression and
   interrelated functions is a remarkable genomic feature which has led to
   suggestions that the region may have a coordinated transcription control
   mechanism. With the growing awareness that the organization of the
   genome within the interphase nucleus is relevant to transcriptional
   activity, we have investigated the spatial organization of the EDC in
   the nuclei of keratinocytes, where the EDC genes are highly expressed,
   and lymphoblasts, where they are silent. Using 2D and 3D FISH we find
   that in keratinocyte nuclei the EDC is frequently positioned external to
   the chromosome 1 territory compared to lymphoblasts where the EDC more
   often adopts a peripheral or internal location. It has been previously
   shown that the MHC region can extend from the chromosome 6 territory in
   relation to transcriptional activity. This study of the EDC thus
   provides a further example of a gene-dense complex capable of assuming
   extraterritorial positioning in relation to cell type/transcription
   status. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science.},

Abstract = {In the present work Fo center dot rster resonance energy transfer (FRET)
   between DNA-specific fluorescent dyes Hoechst 33258 (Ht58; donor) and
   SYBR Green I (SG; acceptor) is compared in isotropic DNA solution and in
   its chole-steric liquid-crystalline dispersion (DNA CLCD). At a fixed
   donor concentration of 3.57 x 10-6 \textbackslash{}M in the spatially
   ordered system, FRET starts at lower acceptor concentration than in the
   isotropic system and at the SG con-centration below 1.05 x 10-7 M, its
   efficiency in DNA CLCD is up to X4-fold higher than in DNA solution (3D
   -FRET vs. 1D-FRET). However, the maximum FRET efficiency is higher in
   isotropic solution (X70\% vs. X50\%, respectively) apparently due to the
   absence of steric restrictions on intermolecular interactions imposed by
   the dense packaging of the DNA molecules. In isotropic DNA solution FRET
   from Ht58 to SG is accompanied by the displacement of Ht58 from the
   minor-groove complex as the SG concentration increased, while the
   displacement of Ht58 in DNA CLCD seems to be limited. Using FRET between
   Ht58 and SG, the formation of DNA CLCD particles via stopped-flow method
   was investigated and for the first time the subsecond stage of the DNA
   CLCD particle formation, generation of ``precholesteric{''} optically
   inactive nuclei, was demonstrated.},

   of epigenetic regulation. The kinase PRK1 (protein kinase C related
   kinase 1, also known as PKN1) phosphorylates histone H3 at threonine 11
   and is involved in the regulation of androgen receptor signalling. Thus,
   it has been identified as a novel drug target but little is known about
   PRK1 inhibitors and consequences of its inhibition.
   Methodology/Principal Finding: Using a focused library screening
   approach, we identified the clinical candidate lestaurtinib (also known
   as CEP-701) as a new inhibitor of PRK1. Based on a generated 3D model of
   the PRK1 kinase using the homolog PKC-theta (protein kinase c theta)
   protein as a template, the key interaction of lestaurtinib with PRK1 was
   analyzed by means of molecular docking studies. Furthermore, the effects
   on histone H3 threonine phosphorylation and androgen-dependent gene
   expression was evaluated in prostate cancer cells.
   Conclusions/Significance: Lestaurtinib inhibits PRK1 very potently in
   vitro and in vivo. Applied to cell culture it inhibits histone H3
   threonine phosphorylation and androgen-dependent gene expression, a
   feature that has not been known yet. Thus our findings have implication
   both for understanding of the clinical activity of lestaurtinib as well
   as for future PRK1 inhibitors.},

Abstract = {Centromeres are the genomic regions that organize and regulate
   chromosome behaviours during cell cycle, and their variations are
   associated with genome instability, karyotype evolution and speciation
   in eukaryotes. The highly repetitive and epigenetic nature of
   centromeres were documented during the past half century. With the aid
   of rapid expansion in genomic biotechnology tools, the complete sequence
   and structural organization of several plant and human centromeres were
   revealed recently. Here, we systematically summarize the current
   knowledge of centromere biology with regard to the DNA compositions and
   the histone H3 variant (CENH3)-dependent centromere establishment and
   identity. We discuss the roles of centromere to ensure cell division and
   to maintain the three-dimensional (3D) genomic architecture in different
   species. We further highlight the potential applications of manipulating
   centromeres to generate haploids or to induce polyploids offspring in
   plant for breeding programs, and of targeting centromeres with
   CRISPR/Cas for chromosome engineering and speciation. Finally, we also
   assess the challenges and strategies for de novo design and synthesis of
   centromeres in plant artificial chromosomes. The biotechnology
   applications of plant centromeres will be of great potential for the
   genetic improvement of crops and precise synthetic breeding in the
   future.},

Title = {Maduromycosis of the hand - With special reference to heretofore
   undescribed foreign body granulomas formed around disintegrated
   chlamydospores},
Journal = {ARCHIVES OF PATHOLOGY},
Year = {1944},
Volume = {37},
Number = {5},
Pages = {0309-0318},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The case presented in this report appears to be the first example of
   maduromycosis of the hand to be described in the U. S., the 2d on the N.
   American continent and the 5th thus far recorded. It is probable that
   additional cases have been observed in this and other parts of the world
   but not recorded. It is believed that foreign body granulomas formed
   around chlamydospores in the tissues involved in maduromycosis have not
   been previously described. Of these there are 3 types. Most of them are
   encapsulated. One type is immature and the disintegrated chlamydospores
   in it are displayed against a background composed almost entirely of
   polymorpnonuclear neutrophilic leukocytes. Encapsulation, if present, is
   ill defined. The 2d or intermediary form contains clumps of
   disintegrated chlamydospores and young giant cells, many of which
   present curious configurations and are poor in nuclear chromatin.
   Granulomas of this type are often encapsulated, usually by young
   connective tissue. The 3d type of granuloma is mature. The giant cells
   in it engage in phagocytosing waste material derived from the
   disintegration of chlamydospores. In some instances the mature granuloma
   is encapsulated by well organized connective tissue; in others, by
   connective tissue that is cellular and obviously young. There is a type
   of granuloma in which, apparently, either chlamydospores were originally
   present but dropped out in the process of embedding, or the
   chlamydospores around which it is formed lie beyond the path of the
   microtome knife. It is possible but not probable that this type may be
   formed around the remains of foam cells. It consists of broad
   multinuclear spindle cells arranged around slit-like lumens or of a
   combination of giant and spindle cells arranged around the collapsed
   membranes of foam cells. Granulomas of this type are sometimes
   encapsulated by young connective tissue. Finally, there are numerous
   instances in which chlamydospores lie free in the tissues involved in
   maduromycosis without any noteworthy reaction around them. Encapsulation
   of the granulomas in maduromycosis is obviously indicative of an attempt
   to promote healing. Fibrous replacement of foam cells may be interpreted
   as an effort in the same direction. This statement applies also to the
   argyrophilic reticulum which is liberally distributed through the
   nodules. Precedents for the latter conclusion are set by those young
   epithelioid tubercles which are partly or almost completely replaced by
   overgrowth of argyrophilic reticulum and by the nodules of Kaposi''s
   fibroblastic sarcoma showing overgrowth of the same sort of reticulum.
   Histologically maduromycosis could scarcely be confused with any other
   known disease, more especially with actinomycosis. The granuloma of
   maduromycosis is formed around degenerate chlamydospores; that of
   actinomycosis, around ray fungi. Both are foreign body reactions and
   bear only a remote resemblance to one another. The causative fungi are
   closely related, but the diseases are different from the clinical,
   mycologic and histologic aspects. It seems to us that the classification
   of Chalmers and Archibald should be abandoned on the ground that it
   commits one to the belief that maduromy-cosis and actinomycosis are
   different forms of the same disease.},

Abstract = {We have comprehensively mapped long-range associations between
   chromosomal regions throughout the fission yeast genome using the latest
   genomics approach that combines next generation sequencing and
   chromosome conformation capture (3C). Our relatively simple approach,
   referred to as enrichment of ligation products (ELP), involves digestion
   of the 3C sample with a 4 bp cutter and self-ligation, achieving a
   resolution of 20 kb. It recaptures previously characterized genome
   organizations and also identifies new and important interactions. We
   have modeled the 3D structure of the entire fission yeast genome and
   have explored the functional relationships between the global genome
   organization and transcriptional regulation. We find significant
   associations among highly transcribed genes. Moreover, we demonstrate
   that genes co-regulated during the cell cycle tend to associate with one
   another when activated. Remarkably, functionally defined genes derived
   from particular gene ontology groups tend to associate in a
   statistically significant manner. Those significantly associating genes
   frequently contain the same DNA motifs at their promoter regions,
   suggesting that potential transcription factors binding to these motifs
   are involved in defining the associations among those genes. Our study
   suggests the presence of a global genome organization in fission yeast
   that is functionally similar to the recently proposed mammalian
   transcription factory.},

Title = {New development of fluorescence correlation spectroscopy},
Journal = {CHINESE SCIENCE BULLETIN-CHINESE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {68},
Number = {34},
Pages = {4674-4691},
Abstract = {Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) is a powerful technique that
   combines single-molecule fluorescence detection technology with
   statistical spectroscopy methods. It utilizes confocal fluorescence
   measurement optical design and single-photon counting methods to measure
   the fluctuation of fluorescence signals caused by the movement of
   fluorescent molecules in a small detection volume. By analyzing the
   correlation function of these fluctuations, important parameters such as
   the rate of diffusion and the average number of molecules in the
   detection space can be obtained. This technique is widely used in
   various fields including biomedicine, biophysics, and chemistry due to
   its high resolution and sensitivity. In 1993, Rigler et al. demonstrated
   that FCS can be used for single-molecule detection, which opened the
   doors for the single-point FCS application in the biological field.
   Initially, single-point FCS could only be applied to a single community,
   but the development of fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy
   (FCCS) made it possible to measure interactions between different
   species. However, parameters such as labeling efficiency and binding
   stoichiometry can introduce artifacts in FCCS. Sweeping FCS overcomes
   the limitation of single-point FCS, which is suitable only for the
   measurement of slowly diffusing substances or biological structures.
   Moreover, when combined with stimulated emission depletion (STED)
   imaging techniques, it enables the study of molecular diffusion patterns
   at spatial scales below the diffraction limit of light. Bifocal FCS
   avoids recalibration of the system by defining two overlapping laser
   spots at fixed distances. Multi-parallel FCS (mp FCS) maximizes data
   utilization and enables analysis of different FCS techniques in a single
   measurement. Scanning FCS is widely used for measuring membrane proteins
   and distinguishing specific protein domains based on different diffusion
   coefficients. Combined with STED technology, it can directly observe
   nanoscale dynamics of membrane lipids in living cells. FCS has also been
   employed to investigate the impact of chromatin on the diffusion of
   inert fluorescent tracers, specifically GFP oligomers, of varying sizes.
   This analysis provides insights into cell permeability and
   microstructures. In order to determine the oligomeric state of
   fluorescent proteins, it is occasionally required to conduct PCH and
   N\&B analyses. FCCS is often utilized to study protein-protein
   interactions, protein-nucleic acid interactions, and nucleus-nucleic
   acid interactions. However, caution is necessary when interpreting
   enzyme kinetics using FCS, as enhanced enzyme diffusion may be related
   to average FCS measurements. FCS can be combined with light sheet
   microscopy to measure 3D samples including cells and small organisms.
   Despite its usefulness, FCS also faces challenges. Firstly, FCS is
   restricted to a specific concentration range. Secondly, the
   interpretation of the correlation function relies on fitting it to a
   theoretical model, the selection of which may be ambiguous. Lastly, the
   data quantity in the multiplexed FCS model poses difficulties in both
   fitting the data and providing explanations. FCS has experienced
   significant expansion and has been customized to address specific
   biological inquiries. This diverse growth enables the measurement of
   molecular interactions in living samples, granting accessibility to a
   broader range of researchers.
   It is our belief that these advancements in FCS technology will continue
   to contribute significantly to the field of life sciences, facilitating
   the resolution of complex biological problems.},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Chromosome conformation capture (3C) and 3C-based technology have
   revolutionized studies on chromosomal interactions and their role in
   gene regulation and chromosome organization. 3C allows the in vivo
   identification of physical interactions between chromosomal regions.
   Such interactions are shown to play a role in various aspects of gene
   regulation, for example transcriptional activation of genes by remote
   enhancer sequences, or the silencing by Polycomb-group complexes. The
   last few years the number of publications involving chromosomal
   interactions increased significantly. Until now, however, the vast
   majority of the studies reported are performed in yeast or animal
   systems. So far, studies on plant systems are extremely limited,
   possibly due to the plant-specific characteristics that hamper the
   implementation of the 3C technique. In this paper we provide a
   plant-specific 3C protocol, optimized for maize tissue, and an extensive
   discussion on (i) plant-specific adjustments to the protocol, and (ii)
   solutions to problems that may arise when optimizing the protocol for
   the tissue or plant of interest. Together, this paper should facilitate
   the application of 3C technology to plant tissue and stimulate studies
   on the 3D conformation of chromosomal regions and chromosomes in plants.

   glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-regulated transcription sites (TSs) under
   pulsed (ultradian) and constant hormone stimulation. In contrast to
   constant stimulation, pulsed stimulation induces restricted bursting
   centered around the hormonal pulse. Moreover, we demonstrate that
   transcription factor (TF) nuclear mobility determines burst duration,
   whereas its bound fraction determines burst frequency. Using 3D tracking
   of TSs, we directly correlate TF binding and RNA synthesis at a specific
   promoter. Finally, we uncover a striking co-bursting pattern between TSs
   located at proximal and distal positions in the nucleus. Together, our
   data reveal a dynamic interplay between TF mobility and RNA bursting
   that is responsive to stimuli strength, type, modality, and duration.},

Abstract = {Despite the broadly conserved role of microtubules in chromosome
   segregation, we have a limited understanding of how molecular features
   of tubulin proteins contribute to the underlying mechanisms. Here we
   investigate the negatively charged carboxy-terminal tail domains (CTTs)
   of alpha- and beta-tubulins, using a series of mutants that alter or
   ablate CTTs in budding yeast. We find that ablating beta-CTT causes
   elevated rates of chromosome loss and cell cycle delay. Complementary
   live-cell imaging and electron tomography show that beta-CTT is
   necessary to properly position kinetochores and organize microtubules
   within the assembling spindle. We identify a minimal region of
   negatively charged amino acids that is necessary and sufficient for
   proper chromosome segregation and provide evidence that this function
   may be conserved across species. Our results provide the first in vivo
   evidence of a specific role for tubulin CTTs in chromosome segregation.
   We propose that beta-CTT promotes the ordered segregation of chromosomes
   by stabilizing the spindle and contributing to forces that move
   chromosomes toward the spindle poles.},

Abstract = {The spatial architecture and dynamics of the genomic material in the
   limited volume of the nucleus plays an important role in biological
   processes ranging from gene expression to DNA repair. Yet, detailed
   descriptions of dynamic genome architecture are still lacking and its
   governing principles and functional implications remain largely unknown.
   Powerful experimental methods have been developed to address this gap,
   including single-cell imaging and chromosome conformation capture
   methods, leading to rapidly growing quantitative data sets. Despite
   their importance, however, these data are insufficient to provide a full
   understanding of genome architecture and function. Computational models
   are becoming an increasingly indispensable complement in order to make
   sense of the experimental data and to allow a quantitative understanding
   of how chromosomes fold, move and interact. Here, we review efforts,
   developed over the last similar to 25 years, to model the large-scale 3D
   organization and dynamics of chromosomes or genomes quantitatively. We
   discuss models based on theories and simulations of polymer physics or
   computational reconstruction methods, highlighting similarities and
   differences between models, as well as limitations and possible
   improvements.},

Title = {New protein-DNA complexes in archaea: a small monomeric protein induces
   a sharp V-turn DNA structure},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {9},
Month = {OCT 3},
Abstract = {MC1, a monomeric nucleoid-associated protein (NAP), is structurally
   unrelated to other DNA-binding proteins. The protein participates in the
   genome organization of several Euryarchaea species through an atypical
   compaction mechanism. It is also involved in DNA transcription and
   cellular division through unknown mechanisms. We determined the 3D
   solution structure of a new DNA-protein complex formed by MC1 and a
   strongly distorted 15 base pairs DNA. While the protein just needs to
   adapt its conformation slightly, the DNA undergoes a dramatic curvature
   (the first two bend angles of 55 degrees and 70 degrees, respectively)
   and an impressive torsional stress (dihedral angle of 106 degrees) due
   to several kinks upon binding of MC1 to its concave side. Thus, it
   adopts a V-turn structure. For longer DNAs, MC1 stabilizes multiple
   V-turn conformations in a flexible and dynamic manner. The existence of
   such V-turn conformations of the MC1-DNA complexes leads us to propose
   two binding modes of the protein, as a bender (primary binding mode) and
   as a wrapper (secondary binding mode). Moreover, it opens up new
   opportunities for studying and understanding the repair, replication and
   transcription molecular machineries of Archaea.},

   confirmed by Xray diffraction analysis where stacked assembly of
   parallel chains interlinked by N-H \& ctdot;S, N-H \& ctdot;N, and C-H
   \& ctdot;N type hydrogen bonds observed in 3D supramolecular packing.
   Hirshfeld Surface (HS) optimizations show prominent N \& ctdot;H/H \&
   ctdot;N (32\%), S \& ctdot;H/H \& ctdot;S (21\%), and C \& ctdot;H/H \&

   Moreover, Density Functional Theory (DFT) at B3LYP/6-31 g(d) and
   LMKLL/DZDP basis sets have been used to ascertain geometry and
   long-range interactions in the complex. In addition, DNA-binding
   analysis has been assessed by inspecting its binding capability to
   calf-thymus DNA (CT DNA) and cytotoxic effects of the complex, and
   K2i-mnt were investigated against Dalton's Lymphoma (DL) malignant

Abstract = {DNA replication occurs in a defined temporal order known as the
   replication timing (RT) program and is regulated during development,
   coordinated with 3D genome organization and transcriptional activity.
   However, transcription and RT are not sufficiently coordinated to
   predict each other, suggesting an indirect relationship. Here, we
   exploit genome-wide RT profiles from 15 human cell types and
   intermediate differentiation stages derived from human embryonic stem
   cells to construct different types of RT regulatory networks. First, we
   constructed networks based on the coordinated RT changes during cell
   fate commitment to create highly complex RT networks composed of
   thousands of interactions that form specific functional subnetwork
   communities. We also constructed directional regulatory networks based
   on the order of RT changes within cell lineages, and identified master
   regulators of differentiation pathways. Finally, we explored
   relationships between RT networks and transcriptional regulatory
   networks (TRNs) by combining them into more complex circuitries of
   composite and bipartite networks. Results identified novel trans
   interactions linking transcription factors that are core to the
   regulatory circuitry of each cell type to RT changes occurring in those
   cell types. These core transcription factors were found to bind
   cooperatively to sites in the affected replication domains, providing
   provocative evidence that they constitute biologically significant
   directional interactions. Our findings suggest a regulatory link between
   the establishment of cell-type-specific TRNs and RT control during
   lineage specification.},

Abstract = {Recently, reprogramming of somatic cells from a differentiated to
   pluripotent state by overexpression of specific external transcription
   factors has been accomplished. It has been widely speculated that an
   undifferentiated state may make donor cells more efficient for nuclear
   transfer. To test this hypothesis, we derived induced pluripotent stem
   cells (iPS cells) from several somatic cell lines: mouse embryonic
   fibroblast (MEF), adult tail tip fibroblast (TTF), and brain neural stem
   cells (NSCs). Three dimensional (3D)-fluorescent in situ hybridization
   (FISH) and quantitative-FISH (Q-FISH) were then used to evaluate
   constitutive (pericentric and telomeric) heterochromatin organization in
   these iPS cells and in their parental differentiated cells. Here, we
   show that important nuclear remodeling and telomeres rejuvenation occur
   in these iPS cells regardless of their parental origin. When we used
   these cells as donors for nuclear transfer, we produced live-born cloned
   mice at much higher rates with the iPS-induced cells than with the
   parental cell lines. Interestingly, we noticed that developmental
   potential after nuclear transfer could be correlated with telomere
   length of the donor cells. Altogether, our findings suggest that
   constitutive heterochromatin organization from differentiated somatic
   cells can be reprogrammed to the pluripotent state by induction of iPS
   cells, which in turn support nuclear transfer procedure quite
   efficiently.},

Title = {Mixing and segregation of ring polymers: spatial confinement and
   molecular crowding effects},
Journal = {NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {16},
Month = {MAY 23},
Abstract = {During the life cycle of bacterial cells the non-mixing of the two
   ring-shaped daughter genomes is an important prerequisite for the cell
   division process. Mimicking the environments inside highly crowded
   biological cells, we study the dynamics and statistical behavior of two
   flexible ring polymers in the presence of cylindrical confinement and
   crowding molecules. From extensive computer simulations we determine the
   degree of ring-ring overlap and the number of inter-monomer contacts for
   varying volume fractions phi of crowders. We also examine the entropic
   demixing of polymer rings in the presence of mobile crowders and
   determine the characteristic times of the internal polymer dynamics.
   Effects of the ring length on ring-ring overlap are also analyzed. In
   particular, on systematic variation of the fraction of crowding
   molecules, a (1 - phi)-scaling is found for the ring-ring overlap length
   along the cylinder axis, and a non-monotonic dependence of the 3D
   ring-ring contact number with a maximum at phi approximate to 0.2 is
   obtained. Our results demonstrate that polymer rings are demixed and
   separated by particular entropy-favourable partitioning of crowders
   along the axis of the cylindrical simulation box. These findings help to
   rationalize the implications of macromolecular crowding for circular DNA
   molecules in confined spaces inside bacteria as well as in localized
   cellular compartments inside eukaryotic cells.},

Title = {Limits of Chromosome Compaction by Loop-Extruding Motors},
Journal = {PHYSICAL REVIEW X},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {9},
Number = {3},
Month = {JUL 11},
Abstract = {During mitosis, human chromosomes are linearly compacted about 1000-fold
   by loop-extruding motors. Recent experiments have shown that condensins
   extrude DNA loops but in a ``one-sided{''} manner. This contrasts with
   existing models, which predict that symmetric, ``two-sided{''} loop
   extrusion accounts for mitotic chromosome compaction. We explore whether
   one-sided extrusion, as it is currently seen in experiments, can compact
   chromosomes by developing a mean-field theoretical model for polymer
   compaction by motors that actively extrude loops and dynamically
   turnover. The model establishes a stringent upper bound of only about
   tenfold for compaction by strictly one-sided extrusion. We confirm this
   result with stochastic simulations. Thus, strictly one-sided extrusion
   as it has been observed so far cannot be the sole mechanism of
   chromosome compaction. However, as shown by the model, other two-sided
   or effectively two-sided mechanisms can achieve sufficient compaction.},

Abstract = {Hyperphosphorylation of the Drosophila melanogaster origin recognition
   complex (DmORC) by cyclin dependent kinases (CDKs) allows nucleotide
   binding but inhibits the ATPase activity of Orc1, and ablates the
   ATP-dependent interaction of ORC with DNA. Here we present single
   particle electron microscopy ( EM) studies of ORC bound to nucleotide in
   both the dephosphorylated and hyper-phosphorylated states. 3D image
   reconstructions show that nucleotide binding gives rise to an analogous
   conformation independent of phosphorylation state. At the intermediate
   resolution achieved in our studies, ATP promotes changes along the
   toroidal core of the complex with negligible differences contributed by
   phosphorylation. Thus, hyperphosphorylation of DmORC does not induce
   meso-scale rearrangement of the ORC structure. To better understand
   ORC's role in origin remodeling, we performed atomic force microscopy
   (AFM) studies that show the contour length of a 688 bp linear DNA
   fragment shortens by the equivalent of similar to 130 bp upon ORC
   binding. This data, coupled with previous studies that showed a linking
   number change in circular DNA upon ORC binding, suggests that ORC may
   wrap the DNA in a manner akin to DnaA. Based on existing data and our
   structures, we propose a subunit arrangement for the AAA+ and winged
   helix domains, and in addition, speculate on a path of the 133 bp of DNA
   around the ORC complex. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Physical interactions between distinct chromosomal genomic loci are
   important for genomic functions including recombination and gene
   expression, but the mechanisms by which these interactions occur remain
   obscure. Using telomeric association as a model system, we analyzed here
   the in vivo organization of chromosome ends of haploid yeast cells
   during interphase. We separately labeled most of the 32 subtelomeres and
   analyzed their positions both in nuclear space and relative to three
   representative reference subtelomeres by high-throughput 3D microscopy
   and image processing. We show that subtelomeres are positioned
   nonrandomly at the nuclear periphery, depending on the genomic size of
   their chromosome arm, centromere attachment to the microtubule
   organizing center (spindle pole body, SPB), and the volume of the
   nucleolus. The distance of subtelomeres to the SPB increases
   consistently with chromosome arm length up to approximate to 300 kb; for
   larger arms the influence of chromosome arm length is weaker, but the
   effect of the nucleolar volume is stronger. Distances between pairs of
   subtelomeres also exhibit arm-length dependence and suggest, together
   with dynamic tracking experiments, that potential associations between
   subtelomeres are unexpectedly infrequent and transient. Our results
   suggest that interactions between subtelomeres are nonspecific and
   instead governed by physical constraints, including chromosome
   structure, attachment to the SPB, and nuclear crowding.},

Abstract = {Using small-angle x-ray scattering, we probe the effect of histone tails
   on both internucleosomal interactions and nucleosome conformation. To
   get insight into the specific role of H3 and H4 histone tails, perfectly
   monodisperse recombinant nucleosome core particles were reconstituted,
   either intact or deprived of both H3 and H4 histone tails (gH3gH4). The
   main result is that H3 and H4 histone tails are necessary to induce
   attractive interactions between NCPs. A pair potential model was used to
   describe interactions between NCPs. At all salt concentrations,
   interactions between gH3gH4 NCPs are best described by repulsive
   interactions exclusively. For intact NCPs, an additional attractive
   term, with a 5-10 kT magnitude and 20 angstrom range, is required to
   account for interparticle interactions above 50 mM monovalent salt.
   Regarding conformation, intact NCPs in solution are similar to NCPs in
   3D crystals. gH3gH4 NCPs instead give rise to slightly different
   small-angle x-ray scattering curves that can be understood as a more
   opened conformation of the particle, where DNA ends are slightly
   detached from the core.},

Abstract = {The TA-isoform of the p63 transcription factor (TAp63) has been reported
   to contribute to clinical aggressiveness in chronic lymphocytic leukemia
   (CLL) in a hitherto elusive way. Here, we sought to further understand
   and define the role of TAp63 in the pathophysiology of CLL. First, we
   found that elevated TAp63 expression levels are linked with adverse
   clinical outcomes, including disease relapse and shorter time-to-first
   treatment and overall survival. Next, prompted by the fact that TAp63
   participates in an NF-KB/TAp63/BCL2 antiapoptotic axis in activated
   mature, normal B cells, we explored molecular links between TAp63 and
   BCL2 also in CLL. We documented a strong correlation at both the protein
   and the messenger RNA (mRNA) levels, alluding to the potential
   prosurvival role of TAp63. This claim was supported by inducible
   downregulation of TAp63 expression in the MEC1 CLL cell line using
   clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)
   system, which resulted in downregulation of BCL2 expression. Next, using
   chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) sequencing, we examined whether
   BCL2 might constitute a transcriptional target of TAp63 and identified a
   significant binding profile of TAp63 in the BCL2 gene locus, across a
   genomic region previously characterized as a super enhancer in CLL.
   Moreover, we identified high-confidence TAp63 binding regions in genes
   mainly implicated in immune response and DNA-damage procedures. Finally,
   we found that upregulated TAp63 expression levels render CLL cells less
   responsive to apoptosis induction with the BCL2 inhibitor venetoclax. On
   these grounds, TAp63 appears to act as a positive modulator of BCL2,
   hence contributing to the antiapoptotic phenotype that underlies
   clinical aggressiveness and treatment resistance in CLL.},

Title = {BCL6B-dependent suppression of ETV2 hampers endothelial cell
   differentiation},
Journal = {STEM CELL RESEARCH \& THERAPY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {15},

Month = {JUL 29},
Abstract = {BackgroundB-cell CLL/lymphoma 6 member B (BCL6B) operates as a
   sequence-specific transcriptional repressor within the nucleus, playing
   crucial roles in various biological functions, including tumor
   suppression, immune response, stem cell self-renew, and vascular
   angiogenesis. However, whether BCL6B is involved in endothelial cell
   (EC) development has remained largely unknown. ETS variant transcription
   factor 2 (ETV2) is well known to facilitate EC differentiation. This
   study aims to determine the important role of BCL6B in EC
   differentiation and its potential
   mechanisms.MethodsDoxycycline-inducible human induced pluripotent stem
   cell (hiPSC) lines with BCL6B overexpression or BCL6B knockdown were
   established and subjected to differentiate into ECs and vessel organoids
   (VOs). RNA sequencing analysis was performed to identify potential
   signal pathways regulated by BCL6B during EC differentiation from
   hiPSCs. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to detect the
   expression of pluripotency and vascular-specific marker genes
   expression. EC differentiation efficiency was determined by Flow
   cytometry analysis. The performance of EC was evaluated by in vitro Tube
   formation assay. The protein expression and the vessel-like structures
   were assessed using immunofluorescence analysis or western blot.
   Luciferase reporter gene assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation
   (ChIP)-PCR analysis were used to determine the regulatory relationship
   between BCL6B and ETV2.ResultsFunctional ECs and VOs were successfully
   generated from hiPSCs. Notably, overexpression of BCL6B suppressed while
   knockdown of BCL6B improved EC differentiation from hiPSCs.
   Additionally, the overexpression of BCL6B attenuated the capacity of
   derived hiPSC-ECs to form a tubular structure. Furthermore, compared to
   the control VOs, BCL6B overexpression repressed the growth of VOs,
   whereas BCL6B knockdown had little effect on the size of VOs. RNA
   sequencing analysis confirmed that our differentiation protocol induced
   landscape changes for cell/tissue/system developmental process,
   particularly vascular development and tube morphogenesis, which were
   significantly modulated by BCL6B. Subsequent experiments confirmed the
   inhibitory effect of BCL6B is facilitated by the binding of BCL6B to the
   promoter region of ETV2, led to the suppression of ETV2's
   transcriptional activity. Importantly, the inhibitory effect of BCL6B
   overexpression on EC differentiation from hiPSCs could be rescued by
   ETV2 overexpression.ConclusionsBCL6B inhibits EC differentiation and
   hinders VO development by repressing the transcriptional activity of
   ETV2.},

Abstract = {Even though the promising therapies against cancer are rapidly improved,
   the oncology patients population has seen exponential growth, placing
   cancer in 5(th) place among the ten deadliest diseases. Efficient drug
   delivery systems must overcome multiple barriers and maximize drug
   delivery to the target tumors, simultaneously limiting side effects.
   Since the first observation of the quantum tunneling phenomenon, many
   multidisciplinary studies have offered quantum-inspired solutions to
   optimized tumor mapping and efficient nanodrug design. The property of a
   wave function to propagate through a potential barrier offer the
   capability of obtaining 3D surface profiles using imaging of individual
   atoms on the surface of a material. The application of quantum tunneling
   on a scanning tunneling microscope offers an exact surface roughness
   mapping of tumors and pharmaceutical particles. Critical elements to
   cancer nanotherapeutics apply the fractal theory and calculate the
   fractal dimension for efficient tumor surface imaging at the atomic
   level. This review study presents the latest biological approaches to
   cancer management based on fractal geometry. ``As far as the laws of
   mathematics refer to reality, they are not certain, and as far as they
   are certain, they do not refer to reality.{''}.Albert Einstein},

   primarily responsible for the mechanical stability of the nucleus in
   multicellular organisms. However, structural-mechanical characterization
   of lamin filaments assembled in situ remains elusive. Here, we apply an
   integrative approach combining atomic force microscopy, cryo-electron
   tomography, network analysis, and molecular dynamics simulations to
   directly measure the mechanical response of single lamin filaments in
   three-dimensional meshwork. Endogenous lamin filaments portray
   non-Hookean behavior - they deform reversibly at a few hundred
   picoNewtons and stiffen at nanoNewton forces. The filaments are
   extensible, strong and tough similar to natural silk and superior to the
   synthetic polymer Kevlar((R)). Graph theory analysis shows that the
   lamin meshwork is not a random arrangement of filaments but exhibits
   small-world properties. Our results suggest that lamin filaments arrange
   to form an emergent meshwork whose topology dictates the mechanical
   properties of individual filaments. The quantitative insights imply a
   role of meshwork topology in laminopathies. Mechanical strength of in
   situ assembled nuclear lamin filaments arranged in a 3D meshwork is
   unclear. Here, using mechanical, structural and simulation tools, the
   authors report the hierarchical organization of the lamin meshwork that
   imparts strength and toughness to lamin filaments at par with silk and
   Kevlar((R))},

Title = {An explainable artificial intelligence approach for decoding the
   enhancer histone modifications code and identification of novel
   enhancers in Drosophila},
Journal = {GENOME BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {22},
Number = {1},
Month = {NOV 8},
Abstract = {Background Enhancers are non-coding regions of the genome that control
   the activity of target genes. Recent efforts to identify active
   enhancers experimentally and in silico have proven effective. While
   these tools can predict the locations of enhancers with a high degree of
   accuracy, the mechanisms underpinning the activity of enhancers are
   often unclear. Results Using machine learning (ML) and a rule-based
   explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) model, we demonstrate that we
   can predict the location of known enhancers in Drosophila with a high
   degree of accuracy. Most importantly, we use the rules of the XAI model
   to provide insight into the underlying combinatorial histone
   modifications code of enhancers. In addition, we identified a large set
   of putative enhancers that display the same epigenetic signature as
   enhancers identified experimentally. These putative enhancers are
   enriched in nascent transcription, divergent transcription and have 3D
   contacts with promoters of transcribed genes. However, they display only
   intermediary enrichment of mediator and cohesin complexes compared to
   previously characterised active enhancers. We also found that 10-15\% of
   the predicted enhancers display similar characteristics to super
   enhancers observed in other species. Conclusions Here, we applied an
   explainable AI model to predict enhancers with high accuracy. Most
   importantly, we identified that different combinations of epigenetic
   marks characterise different groups of enhancers. Finally, we discovered
   a large set of putative enhancers which display similar characteristics
   with previously characterised active enhancers.},

Year = {1998},
Volume = {6},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The wheat-Thinopyrum amphiploid `Agrotriticum \# 3425' (AT 3425), which
   is highly resistant to Cephalosporium stripe, was identified to carry
   seven pairs of Thinopyrum chromosomes, three pairs of wheat-Thinopyrum
   translocated chromosomes and 18 pairs of wheat chromosomes. Fluorescence
   genomic in situ hybridization (FGISH), C-banding, sequential C-banding
   and FGISH, and denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE)
   were used to characterize and identify the chromosomes. The Thinopyrum
   chromosomes in AT 3425 were designated as T-1 through T-7 based on their
   C-banding patterns. The FGISH and C-banding patterns of mitotic
   chromosomes in AT 3425 and meiotic chromosomes in the hybrid between AT
   3425 and wheat cultivar `Chinese Spring' (CS) revealed that wheat
   chromosomes 1D, 2B and 3D were involved in the three wheat-Thinopyrum
   chromosome translocations designated as (W-T)(1), (W-T)(2), and (W-T)(3)
   respectively. The analysis of high-molecular-weight glutenin subunits in
   single seeds of AT 3425 confirmed the involvement of wheat chromosome 1D
   in the translocation (W-T)(1). The designations 1DS.1DL-1TL, 2BS.2BL-2TL
   and 3DS.3DL-3TL were suggested for the wheat-Thinopyrum translocated
   chromosomes (W-T)(1), (W-T)(2) and (W-T)(3) in AT 3425 respectively.},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {It has been 8 years since the concept of naive and primed pluripotent
   stem cell states was first proposed. Both are states of pluripotency,
   but exhibit slightly different properties. The naive state represents
   the cellular state of the preimplantation mouse blastocyst inner cell
   mass, while the primed state is representative of the post-implantation
   epiblast cells. These two cell types exhibit clearly distinct
   developmental potential, as evidenced by the fact that naive cells are
   able to contribute to blastocyst chimeras, while primed cells cannot.
   However, the epigenetic differences that underlie the distinct
   developmental potential of these cell types remain unclear, which is
   rather surprising given the large amount of active investigation over
   the years. Elucidating such epigenetic differences should lead to a
   better understanding of the fundamental properties of these states of
   pluripotency and the means by which the naive-to-primed transition
   occurs, which may provide insights into the essence of stem cell
   commitment.},

Abstract = {In this work we have studied the properties of the novel mouse histone
   variant H2AL2. H2AL2 was used to reconstitute nucleosomes and the
   structural and functional properties of these particles were studied by
   a combination of biochemical approaches, atomic force microscopy (AFM)
   and electron cryo-microscopy. DNase I and hydroxyl radical footprinting
   as well as micrococcal and exonuclease III digestion demonstrated an
   altered structure of the H2AL2 nucleosomes all over the nucleosomal DNA
   length. Restriction nuclease accessibility experiments revealed that the
   interactions of the H2AL2 histone octamer with the ends of the
   nucleosomal DNA are highly perturbed. AFM imaging showed that the H2AL2
   histone octamer was complexed with only similar to 130 bp of DNA. H2AL2
   reconstituted trinucleosomes exhibited a type of a `beads on a string'
   structure, which was quite different from the equilateral triangle 3D
   organization of conventional H2A trinucleosomes. The presence of H2AL2
   affected both the RSC and SWI/SNF remodeling and mobilization of the
   variant particles. These unusual properties of the H2AL2 nucleosomes
   suggest a specific role of H2AL2 during mouse spermiogenesis.},

   in regulating transcription and the nuclear acetylome. While P300 has
   been shown to be required for the transcription of certain early flow
   responsive genes, relatively little is known about its role in the
   endothelial response to hemodynamic fluid stress. Here we sought to
   define the role of P300 in mechanotransduction of fluid shear stress in
   the vascular endothelium.MethodsTo characterize cellular
   mechanotransduction and physical properties after perturbation of P300,
   we performed bulk RNA sequencing, confocal and Brillouin microscopy, and
   functional assays on HUVEC.ResultsInhibition of P300 in HUVEC triggers a
   hyper-alignment phenotype, with cells aligning to flow sooner and more
   uniformly in the presence of the P300 inhibitor A-485 compared to load
   controls. Bulk transcriptomics revealed differential expression of genes
   related to the actin cytoskeleton and migration in cells exposed to
   A-485. Scratch wound and bead sprouting assays demonstrated that
   treatment with A-485 increased 2D and 3D migration of HUVEC. Closer
   examination of filamentous actin revealed the presence of a perinuclear
   actin cap in both P300 knockdown HUVEC and HUVEC treated with A-485.
   Interrogation of cell mechanical properties via Brillouin microscopy
   demonstrated that HUVEC treated with A-485 had lower Brillouin shifts in
   both the cell body and the nucleus, suggesting that P300 inhibition
   triggers an increase in cellular and nuclear
   compliance.ConclusionsTogether, these results point to a novel role of
   P300 in modulating endothelial cell mechanics and mechanotransduction of
   hemodynamic shear stress.},

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN GENETICS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {11},
Month = {JUL 30},
Abstract = {Cancer has an important and considerable gender differential
   susceptibility confirmed by several epidemiological studies. Gastric
   (GC) and thyroid cancer (TC) are examples of malignancies with a higher
   incidence in males and females, respectively. Beyond environmental
   predisposing factors, it is expected that gender-specific gene
   deregulation contributes to this differential incidence. We performed a
   detailed characterization of the transcriptomic differences between
   genders in normal and tumor tissues from stomach and thyroid using
   Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
   data. We found hundreds of sex-biased genes (SBGs). Most of the SBGs
   shared by normal and tumor belong to sexual chromosomes, while the
   normal and tumor-specific tend to be found in the autosomes. Expression
   of several cancer-associated genes is also found to differ between sexes
   in both types of tissue. Thousands of differentially expressed genes
   (DEGs) between paired tumor-normal tissues were identified in GC and TC.
   For both cancers, in the most susceptible gender, the DEGs were mostly
   under-expressed in the tumor tissue, with an enrichment for
   tumor-suppressor genes (TSGs). Moreover, we found gene networks
   preferentially associated to males in GC and to females in TC and
   correlated with cancer histological subtypes. Our results shed light on
   the molecular differences and commonalities between genders and provide
   novel insights in the differential risk underlying these cancers.},

Abstract = {Changes in gene expression represent an important source of phenotypic
   innovation. Yet how such changes emerge and impact the evolution of
   traits remains elusive. Here, we explore the molecular mechanisms
   associated with the development of masculinizing ovotestes in female
   moles. By performing integrative analyses of epigenetic and
   transcriptional data in mole and mouse, we identified the co-option of
   SALL1 expression in mole ovotestes formation. Chromosome conformation
   capture analyses highlight a striking conservation of the 3D
   organization at the SALL1 locus, but an evolutionary divergence of
   enhancer activity. Interspecies reporter assays support the capability
   of mole-specific enhancers to activate transcription in urogenital
   tissues. Through overexpression experiments in transgenic mice, we
   further demonstrate the capability of SALL1 to induce kidney-related
   gene programs, which are a signature of mole ovotestes. Our results
   highlight the co-option of gene expression, through changes in enhancer
   activity, as a plausible mechanism for the evolution of traits.},

Abstract = {Specific chromosomal translocations are hallmarks of many human
   leukemias. The basis for these translocation events is poorly
   understood, but it has been assumed that spatial positioning of genes in
   the nucleus of hematopoietic cells is a contributing factor. Analysis of
   the nuclear 3D position of the gene MLL, frequently involved in
   chromosomal translocations and five of its translocation partners (AF4,
   AF6, AF9, ENL and ELL), and two control loci revealed a characteristic
   radial distribution pattern in all hematopoietic cells studied. Genes in
   areas of high local gene density were found positioned towards the
   nuclear center, whereas genes in regiODS of low gene density were
   detected closer to the nuclear periphery. The gene density within a 2
   Mbp window was found to be a better predictor for the relative
   positioning of a genomic locus within the cell nucleus than the gene
   density of entire chromosomes. Analysis of the position of MLL, AF4, AF6
   and AF9 in cell lines carrying chromosomal translocations involving
   these genes revealed that the position of the normal genes was different
   from that of the fusion genes, and this was again consistent with the
   changes in local gene density within a 2 Mbp window. Thus, alterations
   in gene density directly at translocation junctions could explain the
   change in the position of affected genes in leukemia cells. (c) 2005

Abstract = {Pairing homologous chromosomes is required for recombination. However,
   in nonmeiotic stages it can lead to detrimental consequences, such as
   allelic misregulation and genome instability, and is rare in human
   somatic cells. How mitotic recombination is prevented-and how genetic
   stability is maintained across daughter cells-is a fundamental,
   unanswered question. Here, we report that both human and mouse cells
   impede homologous chromosome pairing by keeping two haploid chromosome
   sets apart throughout mitosis. Four-dimensional analysis of chromosomes
   during cell division revealed that a haploid chromosome set resides on
   either side of a meridional plane, crossing two centrosomes.
   Simultaneous tracking of chromosome oscillation and the spindle axis,
   using fluorescent CENP-A and centrin1, respectively, demonstrates
   collective genome behavior/segregation of two haploid sets throughout
   mitosis. Using 3D chromosome imaging of a translocation mouse with a
   supernumerary chromosome, we found that this maternally derived
   chromosome is positioned by parental origin. These data, taken together,
   support the identity of haploid sets by parental origin. This haploid
   set-based antipairing motif is shared by multiple cell types, doubles in
   tetraploid cells, and is lost in a carcinoma cell line. The data support
   a mechanism of nuclear polarity that sequesters two haploid sets along a
   subcellular axis. This topological segregation of haploid sets revisits
   an old model/paradigm and provides implications for maintaining mitotic
   fidelity.},

Abstract = {Recent technological advances and new radiobiology challenges are behind
   the great interest in the use of microirradiation techniques for
   radiobiological studies. Radiobiological microbeams are facilities able
   to deliver precise doses of radiation to preselected individual cells
   (or part of them) in vitro and assess their biological consequences on a
   single cell base. They are therefore uniquely powerful tools to address
   specific problems where very precise targeting accuracy and dose
   delivery are required. The majority of radiobiological microbeams are
   centred on particle accelerators in order to irradiated biological
   samples with an exact number of ions. Currently there are only three
   microbeam facilities in routine use which employ focused X-rays: two are
   based on laboratory bench X-ray sources (Queen's University Belfast and
   Nagasaki University) and one developed using synchrotron X-ray beams
   (Photon Factory in Tsukuba, Japan). While low dose rates limit
   laboratory bench sources to a few keV, micronsize X-ray probes of a few
   tens of keV are achievable using synchrotron sources. Each facility has
   however their own benefits and draw back points. Techniques for focusing
   X-rays are well established and continuously improving with focal spots
   down to 50 nm achievable for ultrasoft X-rays using circular diffraction
   gratings known as ``zone plates{''}. Reflection X-ray optics such as
   Kirkpatrick-Baez mirrors and polycapillary systems are also used to
   produce micron size X-ray spots. Combined with nano-positioning accuracy
   of the new generation of stages, improved optics and image analysis
   algorithms, X-ray microbeams are able to address radiobiological issues
   in an unprecedented way.
   Microbeams have contributed significantly to the discovery and
   characterization of important new findings regarding the mechanisms of
   interaction of ionizing radiation with cells and tissues. In particular,
   they have played a fundamental role in the investigation of non-targeted
   effects where radiation response is induced in samples whose DNA has not
   been directly exposed. The exquisite resolution offered by focused X-ray
   probes has allowed important questions regarding the locations and
   mechanisms of subcellular targets to be precisely addressed. Evidences
   of the critical role played by the cytoplasm have been collected and
   radio-sensitivity across the cell nucleus itself is attracting
   considerable interest. Moreover using the microbeam single cell
   approach, it has been possible to study the mechanisms underpinning the
   bystander effect where radiation damage is expressed in cells which have
   not been directly irradiated but were in contact or shared medium with
   directly exposed samples. As a result, microbeam facilities are regarded
   as a main tool for the formulation of a new radiobiological paradigm
   where direct damage to cellular DNA is not a requirement. Additionally,
   the implications of the non-targeted effects in in vivo systems and
   ultimately humans have still to be fully understood. The new generation
   of X-ray microbeams equipped with 3D image stations and higher X-ray
   energies offers the perfect approach to extend targeted studies to
   complex biological models. Finally, the single-cell approach and the
   high spatial resolution offered by the microbeam provide the perfect
   tool to study and quantify the dynamic processes associated with the
   production and repair of DNA damage. Using green fluorescent protein
   (GFP), it is now possible to follow the spatio-temporal development of
   the DNA damage sites which is currently of great interest in order to
   monitor the remodelling of chromatin structure that the cell undergoes
   to deal with DNA damage.},

Title = {Promoter-enhancer interactions identified from Hi-C data using
   probabilistic models and hierarchical topological domains},
Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {8},
Month = {DEC 21},
Abstract = {Proximity-ligation methods such as Hi-C allow us to map physical DNA-DNA
   interactions along the genome, and reveal its organization into
   topologically associating domains (TADs). As the Hi-C data accumulate,
   computational methods were developed for identifying domain borders in
   multiple cell types and organisms. Here, we present PSYCHIC, a
   computational approach for analyzing Hi-C data and identifying
   promoter-enhancer interactions. We use a unified probabilistic model to
   segment the genome into domains, which we then merge hierarchically and
   fit using a local background model, allowing us to identify
   over-represented DNA-DNA interactions across the genome. By analyzing
   the published Hi-C data sets in human and mouse, we identify hundreds of
   thousands of putative enhancers and their target genes, and compile an
   extensive genome-wide catalog of gene regulation in human and mouse. As
   we show, our predictions are highly enriched for ChIP-seq and DNA
   accessibility data, evolutionary conservation, eQTLs and other DNA-DNA
   interaction data.},

Journal = {GENES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {14},

Month = {APR 22},
Abstract = {DNA methylation in neurons is directly linked to neuronal genome
   regulation and maturation. Unlike other tissues, vertebrate neurons
   accumulate high levels of atypical DNA methylation in the CH sequence
   context (mCH) during early postnatal brain development. Here, we
   investigate to what extent neurons derived in vitro from both mouse and
   human pluripotent stem cells recapitulate in vivo DNA methylation
   patterns. While human ESC-derived neurons did not accumulate mCH in
   either 2D culture or 3D organoid models even after prolonged culture,
   cortical neurons derived from mouse ESCs acquired in vivo levels of mCH
   over a similar time period in both primary neuron cultures and in vivo
   development. mESC-derived neuron mCH deposition was coincident with a
   transient increase in Dnmt3a, preceded by the postmitotic marker Rbfox3
   (NeuN), was enriched at the nuclear lamina, and negatively correlated
   with gene expression. We further found that methylation patterning
   subtly differed between in vitro mES-derived and in vivo neurons,
   suggesting the involvement of additional noncell autonomous processes.
   Our findings show that mouse ESC-derived neurons, in contrast to those
   of humans, can recapitulate the unique DNA methylation landscape of
   adult neurons in vitro over experimentally tractable timeframes, which
   allows their use as a model system to study epigenome maturation over
   development.},

Abstract = {To quantify more precisely and more reliably diffusion and reaction
   properties of biomolecules in living cells, a novel closed description
   in 3D of both the bleach and the post-bleach segment of fluorescence
   recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) data acquired at a point, i.e., a
   diffraction-limited observation area, termed point FRAP, is presented.
   It covers a complete coupled reaction-diffusion scheme for mobile
   molecules undergoing transient or long-term immobilization because of
   binding. We assess and confirm the feasibility with numerical solutions
   of the differential equations. By applying this model to free EYFP
   expressed in HeLa cells using a customized confocal laser scanning
   microscope that integrates point FRAP and fluorescence correlation
   spectroscopy (FCS), the applicability is validated by comparison with
   results from FCS. We show that by taking diffusion during bleaching into
   consideration and/or by employing a global analysis of series of bleach
   times, the results can be improved significantly. As the point FRAP
   approach allows to obtain data with diffraction-limited positioning
   accuracy, diffusion and binding properties of the exon-exon junction
   complex (EJC) components REF2-II and Magoh are obtained at different
   localizations in the nucleus of MCF7 cells and refine our view on the
   position-dependent association of the EJC factors with a maturating mRNP
   complex. Our findings corroborate the concept of combining point FRAP
   and FCS for a better understanding of the underlying diffusion and
   binding processes. (c) 2013 International Society for Advancement of

Journal = {CHROMOSOME RESEARCH},
Year = {2003},
Volume = {11},
Number = {5},
Pages = {485-502},
Abstract = {The location of centromeres and telomeres was studied in human and mouse
   lymphocyte nuclei (G0) employing 3D-FISH, confocal microscopy, and
   quantitative image analysis. In both human and murine lymphocytes, most
   centromeres were found in clusters at the nuclear periphery. The
   distribution of telomere clusters, however, differed: in mouse nuclei,
   most clusters were detected at the nuclear periphery, while, in human
   nuclei, most clusters were located in the nuclear interior. In human
   cell nuclei we further studied the nuclear location of individual
   centromeres and their respective chromosome territories (CTs) for
   chromosomes 1, 11, 12, 15, 17, 18, 20, and X. We found a peripheral
   location of both centromeres and CTs for 1, 11, 12, 18, X. A mostly
   interior nuclear location was observed for CTs 17 and 20 and the CTs of
   the NOR-bearing acrocentric 15 but the corresponding centromeres were
   still positioned in the nuclear periphery. Autosomal centromeres, as
   well as the centromere of the active X, were typically located at the
   periphery of the respective CTs. In contrast, in about half of the
   inactive X-CTs, the centromere was located in the territory interior.
   While the centromere of the active X often participated in the formation
   of centromere clusters, such a participation was never observed for the
   centromere of the inactive X.},

Title = {TET3 controls the expression of the H3K27me3 demethylase <i>Kdm6b</i>

Abstract = {The acquisition of cell identity is associated with developmentally
   regulated changes in the cellular histone methylation signatures. For
   instance, commitment to neural differentiation relies on the tightly
   controlled gain or loss of H3K27me3, a hallmark of polycomb-mediated
   transcriptional gene silencing, at specific gene sets. The KDM6B
   demethylase, which removes H3K27me3 marks at defined promoters and
   enhancers, is a key factor in neurogenesis. Therefore, to better
   understand the epigenetic regulation of neural fate acquisition, it is
   important to determine how Kdm6b expression is regulated. Here, we
   investigated the molecular mechanisms involved in the induction of Kdm6b
   expression upon neural commitment of mouse embryonic stem cells. We
   found that the increase in Kdm6b expression is linked to a rearrangement
   between two 3D configurations defined by the promoter contact with two
   different regions in the Kdm6b locus. This is associated with changes in
   5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) levels at these two regions, and requires
   a functional ten-eleven-translocation (TET) 3 protein. Altogether, our
   data support a model whereby Kdm6b induction upon neural commitment
   relies on an intronic enhancer the activity of which is defined by its
   TET3-mediated 5-hmC level. This original observation reveals an
   unexpected interplay between the 5-hmC and H3K27me3 pathways during
   neural lineage commitment in mammals. It also questions to which extent
   KDM6B-mediated changes in H3K27me3 level account for the TET-mediated
   effects on gene expression.},

Abstract = {Electron microscopy of frozen-hydrated samples (cryo-EM) can yield high
   resolution structures of macromolecular complexes by accurately
   determining the orientation of large numbers of experimental views of
   the sample relative to an existing 3D model. The ``initial model
   problem{''}, the challenge of obtaining these orientations ab initio,
   remains a major bottleneck in determining the structure of novel
   macromolecules, chiefly those lacking internal symmetry. We previously
   proposed a method for the generation of initial models - orthogonal tilt
   reconstruction (OTR) - that bypasses limitations inherent to the other
   two existing methods, random conical tilt (RCT) and angular
   reconstitution (AR). Here we present a validation of OTR with a
   biological test sample whose structure was previously solved by RCT: the
   complex between the yeast exosome and the subunit Rrp44. We show that,
   as originally demonstrated with synthetic data, OTR generates initial
   models that do not exhibit the ``missing cone{''} artifacts associated
   with RCT and show an isotropic distribution of information when compared
   with the known structure. This eliminates the need for further user
   intervention to solve these artifacts and makes OTR ideal for automation
   and the analysis of heterogeneous samples. With the former in mind, we
   propose a set of simple quantitative criteria that can be used, in
   combination, to select from a large set of initial reconstructions a
   subset that can be used as reliable references for refinement to higher
   resolution. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Clinical imperatives for new bone to replace or restore the function of
   traumatized or bone lost as a consequence of age or disease has led to
   the need for therapies or procedures to generate bone for skeletal
   applications. However, current in vitro methods for the differentiation
   of human bone marrow stromal cells (HBMSCs) do not, to date, produce
   homogeneous cell populations of the osteogenic or chondrogenic lineages.
   As epigenetic modifiers are known to influence differentiation, we
   investigated the effects of the DNA demethylating agent
   5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC) or the histone deacetylase inhibitor
   trichostatin A (TSA) on osteogenic and chondrogenic differentiation.
   Monolayer cultures of HBMSCs were treated for 3 days with the 5-aza-dC
   or TSA, followed by culture in the absence of modifiers. Cells were
   subsequently grown in pellet culture to determine matrix production.
   5-aza-dC stimulated osteogenic differentiation as evidenced by enhanced
   alkaline phosphatase activity, increased Runx-2 expression in monolayer,
   and increased osteoid formation in 3D cell pellets. In pellets cultured
   in chondrogenic media, TSA enhanced cartilage matrix formation and
   chondrogenic structure. These findings indicate the potential of
   epigenetic modifiers, as agents, possibly in combination with other
   factors, to enhance the ability of HBMSCs to form functional bone or
   cartilage with significant therapeutic implications therein. (c) 2010

Pages = {275-285},
Abstract = {Understanding the spatial organization of the chromosomes in meiotic
   nuclei is crucial to our knowledge of the genome's functional
   regulation, stability and evolution.
   This study examined the nuclear architecture of Mus domesticus 2n=40
   pachytene spermatocytes, analyzing the associations among autosomal
   bivalents via their Centromere Telomere Complexes (CTC).
   The study developed a nuclear model in which each CTC was represented as
   a 3D computer object. The probability of a given combination of
   associations among CTC was estimated by simulating a random distribution
   of 19 indistinguishable CTC over n indistinguishable ``cells{''} on the
   nuclear envelope. The estimated association frequencies resulting from
   this numerical approach were similar to those obtained by quantifying
   actual associations in pachytene spermatocyte spreads. The nuclear
   localization and associations of CTC through the meiotic prophase in
   well-preserved nuclei were also analyzed. We concluded that throughout
   the meiotic prophase: 1) the CTC of autosomal bivalents are not randomly
   distributed in the nuclear space; 2) the CTC associate amongst
   themselves, probably at random, over a small surface of the nuclear
   envelope, at the beginning of the meiotic prophase; 3) the initial
   aggregation of centromere regions occurring in lepto-zygotene likely
   resolves into several smaller aggregates according to patterns of
   preferential partitioning; 4) these smaller aggregates spread over the
   inner face of the nuclear envelope, remaining stable until advanced
   stages of the meiotic prophase or even until the first meiotic division.},

Title = {Three distinct mechanisms of long-distance modulation of gene expression
   in yeast},
Journal = {PLOS GENETICS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {13},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Recent Hi-C measurements have revealed numerous intra-and
   inter-chromosomal interactions in various eukaryotic cells. To what
   extent these interactions regulate gene expression is not clear. This
   question is particularly intriguing in budding yeast because it has
   extensive long-distance chromosomal interactions but few cases of gene
   regulation over-a-distance. Here, we developed a medium-throughput assay
   to screen for functional long-distance interactions that affect the
   average expression level of a reporter gene as well as its cell-to-cell
   variability (noise). We ectopically inserted an insulated MET3 promoter
   (MET3pr) flanked by similar to 1kb invariable sequences into thousands
   of genomic loci, allowing it to make contacts with different parts of
   the genome, and assayed the MET3pr activity in single cells. Changes of
   MET3pr activity in this case necessarily involve mechanisms that
   function over a distance. MET3pr has similar activities at most
   locations. However, at some locations, they deviate from the norm and
   exhibit three distinct patterns including low expression / high noise,
   low expression / low noise, and high expression / low noise. We provided
   evidence that these three patterns of MET3pr expression are caused by
   Sir2-mediated silencing, transcriptional interference, and 3D
   clustering. The clustering also occurs in the native genome and enhances
   the transcription of endogenous Met4-targeted genes. Overall, our
   results demonstrate that a small fraction of long-distance chromosomal
   interactions can affect gene expression in yeast.},

Abstract = {Bleomycin is a redox-active drug with anticancer and other clinical
   applications. It is also frequently used as a tool in fundamental
   research on cellular responses to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). A
   conversion of bleomycin into its DNA-breaking form requires Fe,
   one-electron donors and O-2. Here, we examined how a major biological
   antioxidant ascorbate (reduced vitamin C), which is practically absent
   in standard cell culture, impacts cellular responses to bleomycin. We
   found that restoration of physiological levels of vitamin C in human
   cancer cells increased their killing by bleomycin in 2D cultures and 3D
   tumor spheroids. Higher cytotoxicity of bleomycin occurred in cells with
   normal and shRNA-depleted p53. Cellular vitamin C enhanced the ability
   of bleomycin by produce DSBs, which was established by direct
   measurements of these lesions in three cell lines. Vitamin C-restored
   cancer cells also showed a higher sensitivity to killing by low-dose
   bleomycin in combination with inhibitors of DSB repair-activating ATM or
   DNA-PK kinases. The presence of ascorbate in bleomycin-treated cells
   suppressed a DSB-independent activation of the ATM-CHK2 axis by blocking
   superoxide radical. In vitro studies detected a greatly superior ability
   of ascorbate over other cellular reducers to catalyze DSB formation by
   bleomycin. Ascorbate was faster than other antioxidants in promoting two
   steps in activation of bleomycin. Our results demonstrate strong
   activation effects of vitamin C on bleomycin, shifting its toxicity
   further toward DNA damage and making it more sensitive to manipulations
   of DNA repair.},

Abstract = {Motivation: Describing domain architecture is a critical step in the
   functional characterization of proteins. However, some orphan domains do
   not match any profile stored in dedicated domain databases and are
   thereby difficult to analyze.
   Results: We present here an original novel approach, called TREMOLO-HCA,
   for the analysis of orphan domain sequences and inspired from our
   experience in the use of Hydrophobic Cluster Analysis (HCA). Hidden
   relationships between protein sequences can be more easily identified
   from the PSI-BLAST results, using information on domain architecture,
   HCA plots and the conservation degree of amino acids that may
   participate in the protein core. This can lead to reveal remote
   relationships with known families of domains, as illustrated here with
   the identification of a hidden Tudor tandem in the human BAHCC1 protein
   and a hidden ET domain in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Taf14p and human
   AF9 proteins. The results obtained in such a way are consistent with
   those provided by HHPRED, based on pairwise comparisons of HHMs. Our
   approach can, however, be applied even in absence of domain profiles or
   known 3D structures for the identification of novel families of domains.
   It can also be used in a reverse way for refining domain profiles, by
   starting from known protein domain families and identifying highly
   divergent members, hitherto considered as orphan.},

Title = {Structural basis for the preservation of a subset of topologically
   associating domains in interphase chromosomes upon cohesin depletion},
Journal = {ELIFE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {12},
Month = {MAR 19},
Abstract = {Compartment formation in interphase chromosomes is a result of spatial
   segregation between euchromatin and heterochromatin on a few megabase
   pairs (Mbp) scale. On the sub-Mbp scales, topologically associating
   domains (TADs) appear as interacting domains along the diagonal in the
   ensemble averaged Hi-C contact map. Hi-C experiments showed that most of
   the TADs vanish upon deleting cohesin, while the compartment structure
   is maintained, and perhaps even enhanced. However, closer inspection of
   the data reveals that a non-negligible fraction of TADs is preserved
   (P-TADs) after cohesin loss. Imaging experiments show that, at the
   single-cell level, TAD-like structures are present even without cohesin.
   To provide a structural basis for these findings, we first used polymer
   simulations to show that certain TADs with epigenetic switches across
   their boundaries survive after depletion of loops. More importantly, the
   three-dimensional structures show that many of the P-TADs have sharp
   physical boundaries. Informed by the simulations, we analyzed the Hi-C
   maps (with and without cohesin) in mouse liver and human colorectal
   carcinoma cell lines, which affirmed that epigenetic switches and
   physical boundaries (calculated using the predicted 3D structures using
   the data-driven HIPPS method that uses Hi-C as the input) explain the
   origin of the P-TADs. Single-cell structures display TAD-like features
   in the absence of cohesin that are remarkably similar to the findings in
   imaging experiments. Some P-TADs, with physical boundaries, are relevant
   to the retention of enhancer-promoter/promoter-promoter interactions.
   Overall, our study shows that preservation of a subset of TADs upon
   removing cohesin is a robust phenomenon that is valid across multiple
   cell lines.},

Title = {NuChart: An R Package to Study Gene Spatial Neighbourhoods with
   Multi-Omics Annotations},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {8},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP 19},
Abstract = {Long-range chromosomal associations between genomic regions, and their
   repositioning in the 3D space of the nucleus, are now considered to be
   key contributors to the regulation of gene expression and important
   links have been highlighted with other genomic features involved in DNA
   rearrangements. Recent Chromosome Conformation Capture (3C) measurements
   performed with high throughput sequencing (Hi-C) and molecular dynamics
   studies show that there is a large correlation between colocalization
   and coregulation of genes, but these important researches are hampered
   by the lack of biologists-friendly analysis and visualisation software.
   Here, we describe NuChart, an R package that allows the user to annotate
   and statistically analyse a list of input genes with information relying
   on Hi-C data, integrating knowledge about genomic features that are
   involved in the chromosome spatial organization. NuChart works directly
   with sequenced reads to identify the related Hi-C fragments, with the
   aim of creating gene-centric neighbourhood graphs on which multi-omics
   features can be mapped. Predictions about CTCF binding sites, isochores
   and cryptic Recombination Signal Sequences are provided directly with
   the package for mapping, although other annotation data in bed format
   can be used (such as methylation profiles and histone patterns). Gene
   expression data can be automatically retrieved and processed from the
   Gene Expression Omnibus and ArrayExpress repositories to highlight the
   expression profile of genes in the identified neighbourhood. Moreover,
   statistical inferences about the graph structure and correlations
   between its topology and multi-omics features can be performed using
   Exponential-family Random Graph Models. The Hi-C fragment visualisation
   provided by NuChart allows the comparisons of cells in different
   conditions, thus providing the possibility of novel biomarkers
   identification. NuChart is compliant with the Bioconductor standard and
   it is freely available at ftp://fileserver.itb.cnr.it/nuchart.},

Number = {7},

Abstract = {Transcription machinery depends on the temporal formation of protein-DNA
   complexes. Recent experiments demonstrated that not only the formation
   but also the lifetime of such complexes can affect the transcriptional
   machinery. In parallel, in vitro single-molecule studies showed that
   nucleoid-associated proteins (NAPs) leave the DNA rapidly as the bulk
   concentration of the protein increases via facilitated dissociation
   (FD). Nevertheless, whether such a concentration-dependent mechanism is
   functional in a bacterial cell, in which NAP levels and the 3d
   chromosomal structure are often coupled, is not clear a priori. Here, by
   using extensive coarse-grained molecular simulations, we model the
   unbinding of specific and nonspecific dimeric NAPs from a
   high-molecular-weight circular DNA molecule in a cylindrical structure
   mimicking the cellular confinement of a bacterial chromosome. Our
   simulations confirm that physiologically relevant peak protein levels
   (tens of micromolar) lead to highly compact chromosomal structures. This
   compaction results in rapid off rates (shorter DNA residence times) for
   specifically DNA-binding NAPs, such as the factor for inversion
   stimulation, which mostly dissociate via a segmental jump mechanism.
   Contrarily, for nonspecific NAPs, which are more prone to leave their
   binding sites via 1d sliding, the off rates decrease as the protein
   levels increase. The simulations with restrained chromosome models
   reveal that chromosome compaction is in favor of faster dissociation but
   only for specific proteins, and nonspecific proteins are not affected by
   the chromosome compaction. Overall, our results suggest that the
   cellular concentration level of a structural DNA-binding protein can be
   highly intermingled with its DNA residence time.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES},

Abstract = {Kruppel-associated box (KRAB) zinc finger proteins are a large class of
   tetrapod transcription factors that usually exert transcriptional
   repression through recruitment of TRIM28/KAP1. The evolutionary root of
   modern KRAB domains (mKRAB) can be traced back to an ancestral motif
   (aKRAB) that occurs even in invertebrates. Here, we first stratified
   three subgroups of aKRAB sequences from the animal kingdom (PRDM9, SSX
   and coelacanth KZNF families) and defined ancestral subdomains for
   KRAB-A and KRAB-B. Using human ZNF10 mKRAB-AB as blueprints for
   function, we then identified the necessary amino acid changes that
   transform the inactive aKRAB-A of human PRDM9 into an mKRAB domain
   capable of mediating silencing and complexing TRIM28/KAP1 in human cells
   when employed as a hybrid with ZNF10-B. Full gain of function required
   replacement of residues KR by the conserved motif MLE
   (positionsA32-A34), which inserted an additional residue, and exchange
   of A9/S for F, A20/M for L, and A27/R for V. AlphaFold2 modelling
   documented an evolutionary conserved L-shaped body of two alpha-helices
   in all KRAB domains. It is transformed into a characteristic spatial
   arrangement typical for mKRAB-AB upon the amino acid replacements and in
   conjunction with a third helix supplied by mKRAB-B. Side-chains pointing
   outward from the core KRAB 3D structure may reveal a protein-protein
   interaction code enabling graded binding of TRIM28 to different KRAB
   domains. Our data provide basic insights into structure-function
   relationships and emulate transitions of KRAB during evolution.},

Abstract = {Topologically associating domains (TADs) are the most fundamental
   elements and significant structures of the eukaryotic genome. Currently,
   algorithms have been developed to find the TADs. But few algorithms are

   study, mice Hi-C sequencing data of four contrasts were enrolled.
   Seventeen algorithms, including BPscore, Jaccard index (JI) distance, VI
   distance, image hash, image subtraction, image variance, and so on, were
   used to quantify the genomic similarity of TADs. Image subtraction,
   Euclidean distance, and Manhattan distance were significantly better for
   TAD difference detection than the others. Deferent Hash (dHash) with the
   best zoom size ranked the second, followed by improved Hamming distance
   algorithm and JI distance. Advantages and disadvantages of various
   algorithms for quantifying the similarity of TADs were compared. Our
   work could provide the fundament for TADs comparison.},

Title = {Looping and clustering model for the organization of protein-DNA
   complexes on the bacterial genome},
Journal = {NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {20},
Month = {MAR 26},
Abstract = {The bacterial genome is organized by a variety of associated proteins
   inside a structure called the nucleoid. These proteins can form
   complexes on DNA that play a central role in various biological
   processes, including chromosome segregation. A prominent example is the
   large ParB-DNA complex, which forms an essential component of the
   segregation machinery in many bacteria. ChIP-Seq experiments show that
   ParB proteins localize around centromere-like parS sites on the DNA to
   which ParB binds specifically, and spreads from there over large
   sections of the chromosome. Recent theoretical and experimental studies
   suggest that DNA-bound ParB proteins can interact with each other to
   condense into a coherent 3D complex on the DNA. However, the structural
   organization of this protein-DNA complex remains unclear, and a
   predictive quantitative theory for the distribution of ParB proteins on
   DNA is lacking. Here, we propose the looping and clustering model, which
   employs a statistical physics approach to describe protein-DNA
   complexes. The looping and clustering model accounts for the extrusion
   of DNA loops from a cluster of interacting DNA-bound proteins that is
   organized around a single high-affinity binding site. Conceptually, the
   structure of the protein-DNA complex is determined by a competition
   between attractive protein interactions and loop closure entropy of this
   protein-DNA cluster on the one hand, and the positional entropy for
   placing loops within the cluster on the other. Indeed, we show that the
   protein interaction strength determines the `tightness' of the loopy
   protein-DNA complex. Thus, our model provides a theoretical framework
   for quantitatively computing the binding profiles of ParB-like proteins
   around a cognate (parS) binding site.},

Title = {Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus-Associated Genetic Variants Contribute to
   Overlapping Immune Regulatory Networks},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN GENETICS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {9},
Month = {NOV 21},
Abstract = {Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by
   the autoimmune destruction of insulin-producing pancreatic islet beta
   cells in genetically predisposed individuals. Genome-wide association
   studies (GWAS) have identified over 60 risk regions across the human
   genome, marked by single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which confer
   genetic predisposition to T1D. There is increasing evidence that
   disease-associated SNPs can alter gene expression through spatial
   interactions that involve distal loci, in a tissue-and
   development-specific manner. Here, we used three-dimensional (3D) genome
   organization data to identify genes that physically co-localized with
   DNA regions that contained T1D-associated SNPs in the nucleus. Analysis
   of these SNP-gene pairs using the Genotype-Tissue Expression database
   identified a subset of SNPs that significantly affected gene expression.
   We identified 246 spatially regulated genes including HLA-DRB1, LAT,
   MICA, BTN3A2, CTLA4, CD226, NOTCH1, TRIM26, PTEN, TYK2, CTSH, and FLRT3,
   which exhibit tissue-specific effects in multiple tissues. We observed
   that the T1D-associated variants interconnect through networks that form
   part of the immune regulatory pathways, including immune-cell
   activation, cytokine signaling, and programmed cell death protein-1
   (PD-1). Our results implicate T1D-associated variants in tissue and
   cell-type specific regulatory networks that contribute to pancreatic
   beta cell inflammation and destruction, adaptive immune signaling, and
   immune-cell proliferation and activation. A number of other regulatory
   changes we identified are not typically considered to be central to the
   pathology of T1D. Collectively, our data represent a novel resource for
   the hypothesis-driven development of diagnostic, prognostic, and
   therapeutic interventions in T1D.},

Title = {N- and C-terminal domains in human holocarboxylase synthetase
   participate in substrate recognition},
Journal = {MOLECULAR GENETICS AND METABOLISM},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {96},
Number = {4},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Holocarboxylase synthetase (HCS) catalyzes the binding of the vitamin
   biotin to carboxylases and histones. Carboxylases mediate essential
   steps in macronutrient metabolism. For example, propionyl-CoA
   carboxylase (PCC) catalyzes the carboxylation of propionyl-CoA in the
   metabolism of odd-chain fatty acids. HCS comprises four putative
   domains, i.e., the N-terminus, the biotin transfer/ATP-binding domain, a
   putative linker domain, and the C-terminus. Both N- and C-termini are
   essential for biotinylation of carboxylases by HCS, but the exact
   functions of these two domains in enzyme catalysis are unknown. Here we
   tested the hypothesis that N- and C-termini play roles in substrate
   recognition by HCS. Yeast-two-hybrid (Y2H) assays were used to study
   interactions between the four domains of human HCS with p67, a PCC-based
   polypeptide and HCS substrate. Both N- and C-termini interacted with p67
   in Y2H assays, whereas the biotin transfer/ATP-binding and the linker
   domains did not interact with p67. The essentiality of N- and C-termini
   for interactions with carboxylases was confirmed in rescue experiments
   with mutant Saccharomyces cerevisiae, using constructs of truncated
   human HCS. Finally, a computational biology approach was used to model
   the 3D structure of human HCS and identify amino acid residues that
   interact with p67. In silico predictions were consistent with
   observations from Y2H assays and yeast rescue experiments, and suggested
   docking of p67 near Arg508 and Ser515 within the central domain of HCS.

Title = {The GWAS SNP rs80207740 modulates erythrocyte traits via allele-specific
   binding of IKZF1 and targeting XPO7 gene},
Journal = {FASEB JOURNAL},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {38},
Number = {10},
Month = {MAY 31},
Abstract = {Genome-wide association studies have identified many single nucleotide
   polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with erythrocyte traits. However, the
   functional variants and their working mechanisms remain largely unknown.
   Here, we reported that the SNP of rs80207740, which was associated with
   red blood cell (RBC) volume and hemoglobin content across populations,
   conferred enhancer activity to XPO7 gene via allele-differentially
   binding to Ikaros family zinc finger 1 (IKZF1). We showed that the
   region around rs80207740 was an erythroid-specific enhancer using
   reporter assays, and that the G-allele further enhanced activity. 3D
   genome evidence showed that the enhancer interacted with the XPO7
   promoter, and eQTL analysis suggested that the G-allele upregulated
   expression of XPO7. We further showed that the rs80207740-G allele
   facilitated the binding of transcription factor IKZF1 in EMSA and ChIP
   analyses. Knockdown of IKZF1 and GATA1 resulted in decreased expression
   of Xpo7 in both human and mouse erythroid cells. Finally, we constructed
   Xpo7 knockout mouse by CRISPR/Cas9 and observed anemic phenotype with
   reduced volume and hemoglobin content of RBC, consistent to the effect
   of rs80207740 on erythrocyte traits. Overall, our study demonstrated
   that rs80207740 modulated erythroid indices by regulating IKZF1 binding
   and Xpo7 expression.
   The SNP rs80207740 was associated with erythrocyte traits MCV and MCH in
   multiple GWAS studies. The SNP itself locates in an erythroid enhancer
   within XPO7 gene, showing G-allele-biased activity, and physical
   interaction to the gene at downstream. eQTL analysis associates
   G-allele, which enables preferential IKZF1 binding in Motif analysis,
   EMSA, and ChIP assay, to higher XPO7 expression. Meanwhile IKZF1
   knockdown decreases Xpo7 expression. Consistently, Xpo7-knockout mice
   are embryonic lethal, and survivors display anemic phenotypes with
   reduced RBC volume and hemoglobinization.image},

Abstract = {HOXC6 is a homeobox-containing gene associated with mammary gland
   development and is overexpressed in variety of cancers including breast
   and prostate cancers. Here, we have examined the expression of HOXC6 in
   breast cancer tissue, investigated its transcriptional regulation via
   estradiol (E2) and bisphenol-A (BPA, an estrogenic endocrine disruptor)
   in vitro and in vivo. We observed that HOXC6 is differentially
   over-expressed in breast cancer tissue. E2 induces HOXC6 expression in
   cultured breast cancer cells and in mammary glands of Sprague Dawley
   rats. HOXC6 expression is also induced upon exposure to BPA both in
   vitro and in vivo. Estrogen-receptor-alpha (ER alpha) and
   ER-coregulators such as MLL-histone methylases are bound to the HOXC6
   promoter upon exposure to E2 or BPA and that resulted in increased
   histone H3K4-trimethylation, histone acetylation, and recruitment of RNA
   polymerase II at the HOXC6 promoter. HOXC6 overexpression induces
   expression of tumor growth factors and facilitates growth 3D-colony
   formation, indicating its potential roles in tumor growth. Our studies
   demonstrate that HOXC6, which is a critical player in mammary gland
   development, is upregulated in multiple cases of breast cancer, and is
   transcriptionally regulated by E2 and BPA, in vitro and in vivo.

Abstract = {DNA methyltransferase 1 (Dnmt1) reestablishes methylation of
   hemimethylated CpG sites generated during DNA replication in mammalian
   cells. Two subdomains, the proliferating cell nuclear antigen
   (PCNA)-binding domain (PBD) and the targeting sequence (TS) domain,
   target Dnmt1 to the replication sites in S phase. We aimed to dissect
   the details of the cell cycle-dependent coordinated activity of both
   domains. To that end, we combined super-resolution 3D-structured
   illumination microscopy and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching
   (FRAP) experiments of GFP-Dnmt1 wild type and mutant constructs in
   somatic mouse cells. To interpret the differences in FRAP kinetics, we
   refined existing data analysis and modeling approaches to (i) account
   for the heterogeneous and variable distribution of Dnmt1-binding sites
   in different cell cycle stages; (ii) allow diffusion-coupled dynamics;
   (iii) accommodate multiple binding classes. We find that transient
   PBD-dependent interaction directly at replication sites is the
   predominant specific interaction in early S phase (residence time T-res
   10 s). In late S phase, this binding class is taken over by a
   substantially stronger (T-res similar to 22 s) TS domain-dependent
   interaction at PCNA-enriched replication sites and at nearby
   pericentromeric heterochromatin subregions. We propose a
   two-loading-platform-model of additional PCNA-independent loading at
   postreplicative, heterochromatic Dnmt1 target sites to ensure faithful
   maintenance of densely methylated genomic regions.},

Abstract = {Knowledge of cellular responses in tissue microenvironment is crucial
   for the accurate prediction of human health risks following chronic or
   acute exposure to ionizing radiation (IR). With this objective, we
   investigated the radio responses for the first time in three-dimensional
   (3D) artificial human skin tissue microenvironment after gamma-rays
   radiation. IR-induced DNA damage/repair response was assessed by
   immunological analysis of well-known DNA double strand break (DSB)
   repair proteins, i.e. 53BP1 and phosphorylated ataxia telangiectasia
   mutatedser1981 (ATMser1981). Efficient 53BP1 and phosphorylated ATM foci
   formation was observed in human EpiDerm tissue constructs after low and
   high doses of gamma-rays. Interestingly, EpiDerm tissue constructs
   displayed less 53BP1 and ATM foci number at all radiation doses (0.1, 1,
   2.5 and 5 Gy) than that observed for 2D human fibroblasts. DSB repair
   efficiency judged by the disappearance of 53BP1 foci declined with
   increasing doses of gamma-rays and tissue constructs irradiated with 2.5
   and 5 Gy of gamma-rays displayed 53BP1 foci persisting up to 72 h of
   analysis. Pretreatment of EpiDerm tissue constructs with LY294002, {[}an
   inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase and PI-3 kinase like kinases
   (PIKK)] completely abolished IR-induced 53BP1 foci formation and
   increased the apoptotic death. This observation indicates the importance
   of PIKK signalling pathway for efficient radiation responses in intact
   tissue constructs. In summary, we have successfully demonstrated the
   feasibility of monitoring the DNA damage response in human skin tissue
   microenvironment. In this system, 53BP1 can be used as a useful marker
   for monitoring the DSB repair efficiency.},

Volume = {27},

Abstract = {Proper expression of the PPARG gene, which encodes a key transcription
   factor of adipogenesis, is indispensable in the formation of mature
   adipocytes. The positioning of a gene within the nuclear space has been
   implicated in gene regulation. We here report on the significance of the
   PPARG gene's nuclear positioning for its activity during in vitro
   adipogenesis in the pig. We used an established system of
   differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells derived from bone marrow and
   adipose tissue into adipocytes. The differentiation process was carried
   out for 7 days, and the cells were examined using the 3D DNA/immuno-FISH
   and RNA/DNA-FISH approaches. PPARG transcript level was measured using
   real-time PCR, and PPAR gamma activity was detected with colorimetric
   assay. Changes in the nuclear location of the PPARG gene were observed
   when we compared undifferentiated mesenchymal stem cells with mature
   adipocytes. The gene moved from the nuclear periphery to the nuclear
   center as its transcriptional activity increased. The RNA/DNA-FISH
   approach shows that differences in primary transcript production
   correlated with the allele's nuclear positioning. Transcriptionally
   active alleles preferentially occupy the central part of the nucleus,
   while inactive alleles are found on the nuclear periphery. We also show
   that transcription of PPARG begins with one allele, but that both
   alleles are active in later stages of differentiation. Our results
   provide evidence that functionally distinct alleles of the PPARG gene
   are positioned in different parts of the cell nucleus. This confirms the
   importance of nuclear architecture to the regulation of PPARG gene
   transcription, and thus to the fate of the adipose cell.},

Journal = {CHROMOSOMA},

Abstract = {Chromosome territories assume non-random positions in the interphase
   nucleus with gene-rich chromosomes localized toward the nuclear interior
   and gene-poor chromosome territories toward the nuclear periphery.
   Lamins are intermediate filament proteins of the inner nuclear membrane
   required for the maintenance of nuclear structure and function. Here, we
   show using whole-genome expression profiling that Lamin A/C or Lamin B2
   depletion in an otherwise diploid colorectal cancer cell line (DLD1)
   deregulates transcript levels from specific chromosomes. Further,
   three-dimensional fluorescence in situ hybridization (3D-FISH) analyses
   of a subset of these transcriptionally deregulated chromosome
   territories revealed that the diploid chromosome territories in
   Lamin-depleted cells largely maintain conserved positions in the
   interphase nucleus in a gene-density-dependent manner. In addition,
   chromosomal aneuploidies were induced in similar to 25 \% of Lamin A/C
   or Lamin B2-depleted cells. Sub-populations of these aneuploid cells
   consistently showed a mislocalization of the gene-rich aneuploid
   chromosome 19 territory toward the nuclear periphery, while gene-poor
   aneuploid chromosome 18 territory was mislocalized toward the nuclear
   interior predominantly upon Lamin B2 than Lamin A/C depletion. In
   addition, a candidate gene locus ZNF570 (Chr.19q13.12) significantly
   overexpressed upon Lamin B2 depletion was remarkably repositioned away
   from the nuclear lamina. Taken together, our studies strongly implicate
   an overarching role for Lamin B2 in the maintenance of nuclear
   architecture since loss of Lamin B2 relieves the spatial positional
   constraints required for maintaining conserved localization of aneuploid
   chromosome territories in the interphase nucleus.},

Abstract = {tRNAs are widely believed to segregate into two classes, I and II.
   Computational analysis of eukaryotic tRNA entries in Genomic tRNA
   Database, however, leads to new, albeit paradoxical, presence of more
   than a thousand class-I tRNAs with uncharacteristic long variable arms
   (V-arms), like in class-II. Out of 62,202 tRNAs from 69 eukaryotes, as
   many as 1431 class-I tRNAs have these novel extended V-arms, and we
   refer to them as paradoxical tRNAs (pxtRNAs). A great majority of these
   1431 pxtRNA genes are located in intergenic regions, about 18\% embedded
   in introns of genes or ESTs, and just one in 3UTR. A check on the
   conservations of 2D and 3D base pairs for each position of these pxtRNAs
   reveals a few variations, but they seem to have almost all the known
   features (already known identity and conserved elements of tRNA).
   Analyses of the A-Box and B-Box of these pxtRNA genes in eukaryotes
   display salient deviations from the previously annotated conserved
   features of the standard promoters, whereas the transcription
   termination signals are just canonical and non-canonical runs of
   thymidine, similar to the ones in standard tRNA genes. There is just one
   such pxtRNA(ProAGG) gene in the entire human genome, and the
   availability of data allows epigenetic analysis of this human
   pxtRNA(ProAGG) in three different cell lines, H1 hESC, K562, and NHEK,
   to assess the level of its expression. Histone acetylation and
   methylation of this lone pxtRNA(ProAGG) gene in human differ from that
   of the nine standard human tRNA(ProAGG) genes. The V-arm nucleotide
   sequences and their secondary structures in pxtRNA differ from that of
   class-II tRNA. Considering these differences, hypotheses of alternative
   splicing, non-canonical intron and gene transfer are examined to
   partially improve the Cove scores of these pxtRNAs and to critically
   question their antecedence and novelty.},

Abstract = {Rye is the most important source for the genetic improvement of wheat.
   In this study, two stable wheat-rye primary 1RS.1BL translocation lines,
   RT855-13 and RT855-14, were selected and identified by acid
   polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (A-PAGE), co-dominant PCR, and
   multi-color fluorescence in situ hybridization (MC-FISH) from the
   progeny of the crossing of the wheat cultivar Mianyang11 and a Chinese
   rye Weining. When more than two independent, simple reciprocal
   translocations are involved in a carrier, they are defined as complex
   chromosome translocations (CCT). The MC-FISH results also indicated that
   CCT occurred in RT855-13; namely that, besides 1RS.1BL translocation
   chromosomes, there are other two pairs of balanced reciprocal
   translocations. It was demonstrated that the interchange between a
   distal segment of 4B and long arm of 3D occurred in the RT855-13. The
   novel translocation chromosomes in wheat were recorded as 3DS.4BS(DS)
   and 3DL-4BS(PS).4BL. Reports about CCT as a genetic resource in plant
   breeding programs are scarce. Both lines expressed high resistance to
   Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici, which are prevalent in China and
   are virulent on Yr9, and the CCT line RT855-13 retained better
   resistance as adult plants compared with RT855-14 in the field. Both
   lines, especially the CCT line RT855-13, exhibited better agronomic
   traits than their wheat parent, Mianyang11, indicating that both
   translocation lines could potentially be used for wheat improvement. The
   results also indicated that the position effects of CCT can lead to
   beneficial variations in agronomic and resistant traits, making them a
   valuable genetic resource to wheat breeding programs.},

Abstract = {Here we report that PCAF and human GCN5, two related type A histone
   acetyltransferases, are unstable enzymes that under the commonly used
   assay conditions are rapidly and irreversibly inactivated, Ire addition,
   we report that free histone H1, although not acetylated in vivo, is a
   preferred and convenient in vitro substrate for the study of PCAF, human
   GCN5, and possibly other type A histone acetyltransferases, Using either
   histone H1 or histone H3 as substrates, we find that preincubation with
   either acetyl-CoA or CoA stabilizes the acetyltransferase activities of
   PCAF, human GCN5 and an enzymatically active PCAF deletion mutant
   containing the C-terminal half of the protein. The stabilization
   requires the continuous presence of coenzyme, suggesting that the
   acetyltransferase-coenzyme complexes are stable, while the isolated
   apoenzymes are not, Human GCN5 and the N-terminal deletion mutant of
   PCAF are stabilized equally well by preincubation with either CoA or
   acetyl-CoA, while intact PCAF is better stabilized by acetyl-CoA than by
   CoA, Intact PCAF, but not the N-terminal truncation mutant or human
   GCN5, is auto-acetylated. These findings raise the possibility that the
   intracellular concentrations of the coenzymes affect the stability and
   therefore the nuclear activity of these acetyltransferases.},

Abstract = {Most complex trait-associated variants are located in non-coding
   regulatory regions of the genome, where they have been shown to disrupt
   transcription factor (TF)-DNA binding motifs. Variable TF-DNA
   interactions are therefore increasingly considered as key drivers of
   phenotypic variation. However, recent genome-wide studies revealed that
   the majority of variable TF-DNA binding events are not driven by
   sequence alterations in the motif of the studied TF. This observation
   implies that the molecular mechanisms underlying TF-DNA binding
   variation and, by extrapolation, inter-individual phenotypic variation
   are more complex than originally anticipated. Here, we summarize the
   findings that led to this important paradigm shift and review proposed
   mechanisms for local, proximal, or distal genetic variation-driven
   variable TF-DNA binding. In addition, we discuss the biomedical
   implications of these findings for our ability to dissect the molecular
   role(s) of non-coding genetic variants in complex traits, including
   disease susceptibility.},

Title = {Subnuclear localisation is associated with gene expression more than
   parental origin at the imprinted <i>Dlk1-Dio3</i> locus},
Journal = {PLOS GENETICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {18},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {At interphase, de-condensed chromosomes have a non-random
   three-dimensional architecture within the nucleus, however, little is
   known about the extent to which nuclear organisation might influence
   expression or vice versa. Here, using imprinting as a model, we use 3D
   RNA- and DNA-fluorescence-in-situ-hybridisation in normal and mutant
   mouse embryonic stem cell lines to assess the relationship between
   imprinting control, gene expression and allelic distance from the
   nuclear periphery. We compared the two parentally inherited imprinted
   domains at the Dlk1-Dio3 domain and find a small but reproducible trend
   for the maternally inherited domain to be further away from the
   periphery however we did not observe an enrichment of inactive alleles
   in the immediate vicinity of the nuclear envelope. Using Zfp57KO ES
   cells, which harbour a paternal to maternal epigenotype switch, we
   observe that expressed alleles are significantly further away from the
   nuclear periphery.However, within individual nuclei, alleles closer to
   the periphery are equally likely to be expressed as those further away.
   In other words, absolute position does not predict expression. Taken
   together, this suggests that whilst stochastic activation can cause
   subtle shifts in localisation for this locus, there is no dramatic
   relocation of alleles upon gene activation. Our results suggest that
   transcriptional activity, rather than the parent-of-origin, defines
   subnuclear localisation at an endogenous imprinted domain.
   Author summaryGenomic imprinting is an epigenetically regulated process
   that results in the preferential expression of a subset of
   developmentally regulated genes from either the maternally or the
   paternally inherited chromosomes. We have used imprinted genes as a
   model system to investigate the relationship between the parental origin
   of the chromosomes, the localisation of genes within the cell nucleus
   and their active expression. By assessing the location of the Dlk1-Dio3
   region and the expression of the Gtl2/Meg3 gene within it, we find that
   there is a small preference for the paternal chromosome to be closer to
   the periphery but a significant correlation between transcription and
   distance to the edge of the nucleus for the Gtl2/Meg3 gene. Furthermore,
   a chromosome nearer the periphery is just as likely to express the gene
   as the chromosome further away. These findings suggest that the parental
   origin of the chromosome may not be as important as the transcription of
   the gene in defining the position of the imprinted region within the
   nucleus.},

   Organization},
Journal = {PHYSICAL REVIEW X},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {13},
Number = {4},
Month = {NOV 13},
Abstract = {Chromosomes are exceedingly long topologically constrained polymers
   compacted in a cell nucleus. We recently suggested that chromosomes are
   organized into loops by an active process of loop extrusion. Yet loops
   remain elusive to direct observations in living cells; detection and
   characterization of myriads of such loops is a major challenge. The lack
   of a tractable physical model of a polymer folded into loops limits our
   ability to interpret experimental data and detect loops. Here, we
   introduce a new physical model-a polymer folded into a sequence of
   loops-and solve it analytically. Our model and a simple geometrical
   argument show how loops affect the statistics of contacts in a polymer
   across different scales, explaining universally observed shapes of the
   contact probability. Moreover, we reveal that folding into loops reduces
   the density of topological entanglements, a novel phenomenon we refer to
   as ``the dilution of entanglements.{''} Supported by simulations, this
   finding suggests that up to approximately 1-2-Mb chromosomes with loops
   are not topologically constrained, yet become crumpled at larger scales.
   Our theoretical framework allows inference of loop characteristics,
   draws a new picture of chromosome organization, and shows how folding
   into loops affects topological properties of crumpled polymers.},

Abstract = {Mechanotransduction via yes-associated protein (YAP) is a central
   mechanism for decision-making in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs).
   Nuclear localization of YAP is tightly connected to pluripotency and
   increases the cell division rate (CDR). How the geometry of the
   extracellular environment influences mechanotransduction, thereby YAP
   localization, and decision-making of single isolated mESCs is largely
   unknown. To investigate this relation, we produced well-defined 2D and
   2.5D microenvironments and monitored CDR and subcellular YAP
   localization in single mESCs hence excluding cell-cell interactions. By
   systematically varying size and shape of the 2D and 2.5D substrates we
   observed that the geometry of the growth environment affects the CDR.
   Whereas CDR increases with increasing adhesive area in 2D, CDR is
   highest in small 2.5D micro-wells. Here, mESCs attach to all four walls
   and exhibit a cross-shaped cell and nuclear morphology. This observation
   indicates that changes in cell shape are linked to a high CDR.
   Inhibition of actomyosin activity abrogate these effects.
   Correspondingly, nuclear YAP localization decreases in inhibitor treated
   cells, suggesting a relation between cell shape, intracellular forces,
   and cell division rate. The simplicity of our system guarantees high
   standardization and reproducibility for monitoring stem cell reactions
   and allows addressing a variety of fundamental biological questions on a
   single cell level.},

Title = {CoolBox: a flexible toolkit for visual analysis of genomics data},
Journal = {BMC BIOINFORMATICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {22},

Month = {OCT 10},
Abstract = {Background Data visualization, especially the genome track plots, is
   crucial for genomics researchers to discover patterns in large-scale
   sequencing dataset. Although existing tools works well for producing a
   normal view of the input data, they are not convenient when users want
   to create customized data representations. Such gap between the
   visualization and data processing, prevents the users to uncover more
   hidden structure of the dataset. Results We developed CoolBox-an
   open-source toolkit for visual analysis of genomics data. This
   user-friendly toolkit is highly compatible with the Python ecosystem and
   customizable with a well-designed user interface. It can be used in
   various visualization situations like a Swiss army knife. For example,
   to produce high-quality genome track plots or fetch commonly used
   genomic data files with a Python script or command line, to explore
   genomic data interactively within Jupyter environment or web browser.
   Moreover, owing to the highly extensible Application Programming
   Interface design, users can customize their own tracks without
   difficulty, which greatly facilitate analytical, comparative genomic
   data visualization tasks. Conclusions CoolBox allows users to produce
   high-quality visualization plots and explore their data in a flexible,
   programmable and user-friendly way.},

Title = {Imaging features that discriminate between foci induced by high- and

Journal = {RADIATION RESEARCH},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {165},

Abstract = {In this study, we investigated the formation of radiation-induced foci
   in normal human fibroblasts exposed to X rays or 130 keV/mu m nitrogen
   ions using antibodies to phosphorylated protein kinase ataxia
   telangiectasia mutated (ATMp) and histone H2AX (gamma-H2AX).
   High-content automatic image analysis was used to quantify the
   immunofluorescence of radiation-induced foci. The size of
   radiation-induced foci increased for both proteins over a 2-h period
   after nitrogen-ion irradiation, while the size of radiation-induced foci
   did not change after exposure to low-LET radiation. The number of
   radiation-induced ATMp foci showed a more rapid rise and greater
   frequency after X-ray exposure and was resolved more rapidly such that
   the frequency of radiation-induced foci decreased by 90\% compared to
   60\% after exposure to high-LET radiation 2 h after 30 cGy. In contrast,
   the kinetics of radiation-induced gamma-H2AX focus formation was similar
   for high- and low-LET radiation in that it reached a plateau early and
   remained constant for up to 2 h. High-resolution 3D images of
   radiation-induced gamma-H2AX foci and dosimetry computation suggest that
   multiple double-strand breaks from nitrogen ions are encompassed within
   large nuclear domains of 4.4 Mbp. Our work shows that the size and
   frequency of radiation-induced foci vary as a function of radiation
   quality, dose, time and protein target. Thus, even though double-strand
   breaks and radiation-induced foci are correlated, the dynamic nature of
   both contradicts their accepted equivalence for low doses of different
   radiation qualities. (c) 2006 by Radiation Research Society.},

Pages = {327+},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Despite the well-established role of nuclear organization in the
   regulation of gene expression, little is known about the reverse: how
   transcription shapes the spatial organization of the genome. Owing to
   the small sizes of most previously studied genes and the limited
   resolution of microscopy, the structure and spatial arrangement of a
   single transcribed gene are still poorly understood. Here we study
   several long highly expressed genes and demonstrate that they form
   open-ended transcription loops with polymerases moving along the loops
   and carrying nascent RNAs. Transcription loops can span across
   micrometres, resembling lampbrush loops and polytene puffs. The
   extension and shape of transcription loops suggest their intrinsic
   stiffness, which we attribute to decoration with multiple voluminous
   nascent ribonucleoproteins. Our data contradict the model of
   transcription factories and suggest that although microscopically
   resolvable transcription loops are specific for long highly expressed
   genes, the mechanisms underlying their formation could represent a
   general aspect of eukaryotic transcription.},

Title = {Condensin-driven remodelling of X chromosome topology during dosage

Abstract = {The three-dimensional organization of a genome plays a critical role in
   regulating gene expression, yet little is known about the machinery and
   mechanisms that determine higher-order chromosome structure(1,2). Here
   we perform genome-wide chromosome conformation capture analysis,
   fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), and RNA-seq to obtain
   comprehensive three-dimensional (3D) maps of the Caenorhabditis elegans
   genome and to dissect X chromosome dosage compensation, which balances
   gene expression between XX hermaphrodites and XO males. The dosage
   compensation complex (DCC), a condensin complex, binds to both
   hermaphrodite X chromosomes via sequence-specific recruitment elements
   on X (rex sites) to reduce chromosome-wide gene expression by half(3-7).
   Most DCC condensin subunits also act in other condensin complexes to
   control the compaction and resolution of all mitotic and meiotic
   chromosomes(5,6). By comparing chromosome structure in wild-type and
   DCC-defective embryos, we show that the DCC remodels hermaphrodite X
   chromosomes into a sex-specific spatial conformation distinct from
   autosomes. Dosage-compensated X chromosomes consist of self-interacting
   domains (similar to 1 Mb) resembling mammalian topologically associating
   domains (TADs)(8,9). TADs on X chromosomes have stronger boundaries
   andmore regular spacing than on autosomes. Many TAD boundaries on X
   chromosomes coincide with the highest-affinity rex sites and become
   diminished or lost in DCC-defective mutants, thereby converting the
   topology of X to a conformation resembling autosomes. rex sites engage
   in DCC-dependent long-range interactions, with the most frequent
   interactions occurring between rex sites at DCC-dependent TAD
   boundaries. These results imply that the DCC reshapes the topology of X
   chromosomes by forming new TAD boundaries and reinforcing weak
   boundaries through interactions between its highest-affinity binding
   sites. As this model predicts, deletion of an endogenous rex site at a
   DCC-dependent TAD boundary using CRISPR/Cas9 greatly diminished the
   boundary. Thus, the DCC imposes a distinct higher-order structure onto X
   chromosomes while regulating gene expression chromosome-wide.},

Abstract = {Biological effects of high-LET (linear energy transfer) radiation have
   received increasing attention, particularly in the context of more
   efficient radiotherapy and space exploration. Efficient cell killing by
   high-LET radiation depends on the physical ability of accelerated
   particles to generate complex DNA damage, which is largely mediated by
   LET. However, the characteristics of DNA damage and repair upon exposure
   to different particles with similar LET parameters remain unexplored. We
   employed high-resolution confocal microscopy to examine phosphorylated
   histone H2AX (gamma H2AX)/p53-binding protein 1 (53BP1) focus streaks at
   the microscale level, focusing on the complexity, spatiotemporal
   behaviour and repair of DNA double-strand breaks generated by boron and
   neon ions accelerated at similar LET values (similar to 135 keV mu
   m(-1)) and low energies (8 and 47 MeV per n, respectively). Cells were
   irradiated using sharp-angle geometry and were spatially (3D) fixed to
   maximize the resolution of these analyses. Both high-LET radiation types
   generated highly complex gamma H2AX/53BP1 focus clusters with a larger
   size, increased irregularity and slower elimination than low-LET
   gamma-rays. Surprisingly, neon ions produced even more complex gamma
   H2AX/53BP1 focus clusters than boron ions, consistent with DSB repair
   kinetics. Although the exposure of cells to gamma-rays and boron ions
   eliminated a vast majority of foci (94\% and 74\%, respectively) within
   24 h, 45\% of the foci persisted in cells irradiated with neon. Our
   calculations suggest that the complexity of DSB damage critically
   depends on (increases with) the particle track core diameter. Thus,
   different particles with similar LET and energy may generate different
   types of DNA damage, which should be considered in future research.},

Abstract = {Although often located at a distance from their target gene promoters,
   enhancers are the primary genomic determinants of temporal and spatial
   transcriptional specificity in metazoans. Since the discovery of the
   first enhancer element in simian virus 40, there has been substantial
   interest in unraveling the mechanism(s) by which enhancers communicate
   with their partner promoters to ensure proper gene expression. These
   research efforts have benefited considerably from the application of
   increasingly sophisticated sequencing- and imaging-based approaches in
   conjunction with innovative (epi)genome-editing technologies; however,
   despite various proposed models, the principles of enhancer-promoter
   interaction have still not been fully elucidated. In this review, we
   provide an overview of recent progress in the eukaryotic gene
   transcription field pertaining to enhancer-promoter specificity. A
   better understanding of the mechanistic basis of lineage- and
   context-dependent enhancer-promoter engagement, along with the continued
   identification of functional enhancers, will provide key insights into
   the spatiotemporal control of gene expression that can reveal
   therapeutic opportunities for a range of enhancer-related diseases.
   This review summarizes the current understanding of enhancer-promoter
   interactions (EPIs), a key feature of genome structure, in gene
   regulation and disease. EPIs are crucial for proper gene activity, and
   their alteration by mutational events can be pathological, causing,
   among others, cancer, and neurodevelopmental disorders. The authors
   provide an overview of various methods used to study 3D genome
   architecture (the physical structure of chromosomes) and discuss recent
   insights that these techniques have afforded, especially with regard to
   the specificity and dynamics of EPIs as well as the underlying molecular
   mechanisms. The review highlights the broad experimental utility of
   CRISPR-based strategies and their therapeutic potential for targeting
   disease-related EPIs. While substantial progress has been made, further
   elucidation of the physical and functional interplay of enhancers with
   their cognate promoter(s) will reveal new treatment opportunities for
   many diseases.This summary was initially drafted using artificial
   intelligence, then revised and fact-checked by the author.},

Title = {Epigenomics and transcriptomics of systemic sclerosis CD4+T cells reveal

Abstract = {Background Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a genetically complex autoimmune
   disease mediated by the interplay between genetic and epigenetic factors
   in a multitude of immune cells, with CD4+ T lymphocytes as one of the
   principle drivers of pathogenesis. Methods DNA samples exacted from CD4+
   T cells of 48 SSc patients and 16 healthy controls were hybridized on
   MethylationEPIC BeadChip array. In parallel, gene expression was
   interrogated by hybridizing total RNA on Clariom (TM) S array.
   Downstream bioinformatics analyses were performed to identify
   correlating differentially methylated CpG positions (DMPs) and
   differentially expressed genes (DEGs), which were then confirmed
   utilizing previously published promoter capture Hi-C (PCHi-C) data.
   Results We identified 9112 and 3929 DMPs and DEGs, respectively. These
   DMPs and DEGs are enriched in functional categories related to
   inflammation and T cell biology. Furthermore, correlation analysis
   identified 17,500 possible DMP-DEG interaction pairs within a window of
   5 Mb, and utilizing PCHi-C data, we observed that 212 CD4+ T
   cell-specific pairs of DMP-DEG also formed part of three-dimensional
   promoter-enhancer networks, potentially involving CTCF. Finally,
   combining PCHi-C data with SSc GWAS data, we identified four important
   SSc-associated susceptibility
   loci,TNIP1(rs3792783),GSDMB(rs9303277),IL12RB1(rs2305743),
   andCSK(rs1378942), that could potentially interact with DMP-DEG pairs
   cg17239269-ANXA6, cg19458020-CCR7, cg10808810-JUND, and cg11062629-ULK3,
   respectively. Conclusion Our study unveils a potential link between
   genetic, epigenetic, and transcriptional deregulation in CD4+ T cells of
   SSc patients, providing a novel integrated view of molecular components
   driving SSc pathogenesis.},

Title = {Motif oriented high-resolution analysis of ChIP-seq data reveals the
   topological order of CTCF and cohesin proteins on DNA},
Journal = {BMC GENOMICS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {17},
Month = {AUG 15},
Abstract = {Background: ChIP-seq provides a wealth of information on the approximate
   location of DNA-binding proteins genome-wide. It is known that the
   targeted motifs in most cases can be found at the peak centers. A high
   resolution mapping of ChIP-seq peaks could in principle allow the fine
   mapping of the protein constituents within protein complexes, but the
   current ChIP-seq analysis pipelines do not target the basepair
   resolution strand specific mapping of peak summits.
   Results: The approach proposed here is based on i) locating regions that
   are bound by a sufficient number of proteins constituting a complex; ii)
   determining the position of the underlying motif using either a direct
   or a de novo motif search approach; and iii) determining the exact
   location of the peak summits with respect to the binding motif in a
   strand specific manner. We applied this method for analyzing the
   CTCF/cohesin complex, which holds together DNA loops. The relative
   positions of the constituents of the complex were determined with
   one-basepair estimated accuracy. Mapping the positions on a 3D model of
   DNA made it possible to deduce the approximate local topology of the
   complex that allowed us to predict how the CTCF/cohesin complex locks
   the DNA loops. As the positioning of the proteins was not compatible
   with previous models of loop closure, we proposed a plausible ``double
   embrace{''} model in which the DNA loop is held together by two adjacent
   cohesin rings in such a way that the ring anchored by CTCF to one DNA
   duplex encircles the other DNA double helix and vice versa.
   Conclusions: A motif-centered, strand specific analysis of ChIP-seq data
   improves the accuracy of determining peak positions. If a genome
   contains a large number of binding sites for a given protein complex,
   such as transcription factor heterodimers or transcription
   factor/cofactor complexes, the relative position of the constituent
   proteins on the DNA can be established with an accuracy that allow one
   to deduce the local topology of the protein complex. The proposed high
   resolution mapping approach of ChIP-seq data is applicable for detecting
   the contact topology of DNA-binding protein complexes.},

Abstract = {Topologically Associating Domains (TADs) have been suggested to
   facilitate and constrain enhancer-promoter interactions. However, the
   role of TAD boundaries in effectively restricting these interactions
   remains unclear. Here, we show that a significant proportion of
   enhancer-promoter interactions are established across TAD boundaries in
   Drosophila embryos, but that developmental genes are strikingly enriched
   in intra- but not inter-TAD interactions. We pursued this observation
   using the twist locus, a master regulator of mesoderm development, and
   systematically relocated one of its enhancers to various genomic
   locations. While this developmental gene can establish inter-TAD
   interactions with its enhancer, the functionality of these interactions
   remains limited, highlighting the existence of topological constraints.
   Furthermore, contrary to intra-TAD interactions, the formation of
   inter-TAD enhancer-promoter interactions is not solely driven by genomic
   distance, with distal interactions sometimes favored over proximal ones.
   These observations suggest that other general mechanisms must exist to
   establish and maintain specific enhancer-promoter interactions across
   large distances.

   problems, increasingly parallel high-performance computing is required.
   Here, we show for the prime example of molecular dynamic simulations how
   the presence of large grid clusters including very fast network
   interconnects within grid infrastructures allows now parallel
   high-performance grid computing efficiently and thus combines the
   benefits of dedicated super-computing centres and grid infrastructures.
   The demands for this service class are the highest since the user group
   has very heterogeneous requirements: i) two to many thousands of CPUs,
   ii) different memory architectures, iii) huge storage capabilities, and
   iv) fast communication via network interconnects, are all needed in
   different combinations and must be considered in a highly dedicated
   manner to reach highest performance efficiency. Beyond, advanced and
   dedicated i) interaction with users, ii) the management of jobs, iii)
   accounting, and iv) billing, not only combines classic with parallel
   high-performance grid usage, but more importantly is also able to
   increase the efficiency of IT resource providers. Consequently, the mere
   ``yes-we-can{''} becomes a huge opportunity like e.g. the life-science
   and health-care sectors as well as grid infrastructures by reaching
   higher level of resource efficiency.},

Title = {Distinct roles for H4 and H2A.Z acetylation in RNA transcription in
   African trypanosomes},
Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {11},

Month = {MAR 20},
Abstract = {Despite histone H2A variants and acetylation of histones occurring in
   almost every eukaryotic organism, it has been difficult to establish
   direct functional links between canonical histones or H2A variant
   acetylation, deposition of H2A variants and transcription. To
   disentangle these complex interdependent processes, we devised a highly
   sensitive strategy for quantifying histone acetylation levels at
   specific genomic loci. Taking advantage of the unusual genome
   organization in Trypanosoma brucei, we identified 58 histone
   modifications enriched at transcription start sites (TSSs). Furthermore,
   we found TSS-associated H4 and H2A.Z acetylation to be mediated by two
   different histone acetyltransferases, HAT2 and HAT1, respectively.
   Whereas depletion of HAT2 decreases H2A.Z deposition and shifts the site
   of transcription initiation, depletion of HAT1 does not affect H2A.Z
   deposition but reduces total mRNA levels by 50\%. Thus, specifically
   reducing H4 or H2A.Z acetylation levels enabled us to reveal distinct
   roles for these modifications in H2A.Z deposition and RNA transcription.
   Histone modification and deposition are key regulators of transcription.
   Here, Kraus et al. provide a quantitative histone acetylome for
   Trypanosoma brucei, identify histone modifications enriched at
   transcription start sites, and show how H4 and H2A.Z acetylation affect
   histone deposition and transcription in trypanosomes.},

Title = {Formation of Chromosomal Domains by Loop Extrusion},
Journal = {CELL REPORTS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {15},
Number = {9},
Pages = {2038-2049},
Month = {MAY 31},
Abstract = {Topologically associating domains (TADs) are fundamental structural and
   functional building blocks of human interphase chromosomes, yet the
   mechanisms of TAD formation remain unclear. Here, we propose that loop
   extrusion underlies TAD formation. In this process, cis-acting
   loop-extruding factors, likely cohesins, form progressively larger loops
   but stall at TAD boundaries due to interactions with boundary proteins,
   including CTCF. Using polymer simulations, we show that this model
   produces TADs and finer-scale features of Hi-C data. Each TAD emerges
   from multiple loops dynamically formed through extrusion, contrary to
   typical illustrations of single static loops. Loop extrusion both
   explains diverse experimental observations-including the preferential
   orientation of CTCF motifs, enrichments of architectural proteins at TAD
   boundaries, and boundary deletion experiments-and makes specific
   predictions for the depletion of CTCF versus cohesin. Finally, loop
   extrusion has potentially far-ranging consequences for processes such as
   enhancer-promoter interactions, orientation-specific chromosomal
   looping, and compaction of mitotic chromosomes.},

Title = {Regulators of rDNA array morphology in fission yeast},
Journal = {PLOS GENETICS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {20},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Nucleolar morphology is a well-established indicator of ribosome
   biogenesis activity that has served as the foundation of many screens
   investigating ribosome production. Missing from this field of study is a
   broad-scale investigation of the regulation of ribosomal DNA morphology,
   despite the essential role of rRNA gene transcription in modulating
   ribosome output. We hypothesized that the morphology of rDNA arrays
   reflects ribosome biogenesis activity. We established GapR-GFP, a
   prokaryotic DNA-binding protein that recognizes
   transcriptionally-induced overtwisted DNA, as a live visual fluorescent
   marker for quantitative analysis of rDNA organization in
   Schizosaccharomyces pombe. We found that the morphology-which we refer
   to as spatial organization-of the rDNA arrays is dynamic throughout the
   cell cycle, under glucose starvation, RNA pol I inhibition, and TOR
   activation. Screening the haploid S. pombe Bioneer deletion collection
   for spatial organization phenotypes revealed large ribosomal protein
   (RPL) gene deletions that alter rDNA organization. Further work revealed
   RPL gene deletion mutants with altered rDNA organization also
   demonstrate resistance to the TOR inhibitor Torin1. A genetic analysis
   of signaling pathways essential for this resistance phenotype implicated
   many factors including a conserved MAPK, Pmk1, previously linked to
   extracellular stress responses. We propose RPL gene deletion triggers
   altered rDNA morphology due to compensatory changes in ribosome
   biogenesis via multiple signaling pathways, and we further suggest
   compensatory responses may contribute to human diseases such as
   ribosomopathies. Altogether, GapR-GFP is a powerful tool for live visual
   reporting on rDNA morphology under myriad conditions.
   Cells devote significant energy and resources to produce ribosomes,
   large protein complexes that carry out protein synthesis. To ensure that
   ribosome production matches cellular needs, activation of ribosome
   assembly is regulated by many inputs. One key regulatory target is
   transcription of the tandemly repeated rRNA genes in the ribosomal DNA
   arrays. A broad understanding of how cells regulate the organization of
   the rDNA under different cellular conditions and transcriptional states
   has been difficult to assess with current tools and model systems. We
   present a new imaging reporter, a fluorescently tagged DNA-binding
   protein called GapR, that highlights rDNA spatial organization in
   fission yeast, a model system that shares similar regulatory networks
   with mammals. Using GapR, we found that the 3D organization of the rDNA
   arrays changes with the cell cycle, glucose starvation, RNA pol I
   inhibition, and TOR signaling. We surveyed hundreds of yeast mutants to
   identify factors that regulate rDNA spatial organization, discovering
   that the deletion of ribosome protein genes causes rDNA array expansion.
   Further experiments indicated that ribosome protein insufficiency
   activates conserved regulatory signaling pathways as part of a
   compensatory response. Our work presents the first broad investigation
   for regulators of rDNA spatial organization in any organism.
   Importantly, we identify a compensatory response to compromised ribosome
   biogenesis that could be conserved in mammals.},

Abstract = {Although many regulatory elements in the non-coding genome are linked to
   brain development and disease, deciphering their function has been
   challenging due to the lack of a genomic toolbox. However, recent
   advances in high throughput sequencing techniques have allowed us to
   begin decoding its function, enhancing our understanding of the
   regulatory landscape that underpins human traits and brain disorders.
   Here, we review how the regulatory landscape of the human brain
   undergoes dynamic changes across neurodevelopment, different cell types,
   and human evolution. We then discuss how regulatory landscapes shed
   light onto the molecular basis of neuropsychiatric disorders and guide
   the development of specifically targeted molecular therapies. Finally,
   we offer some thoughts on how these discoveries might impact the
   direction of future studies.},

Abstract = {Vectors for expressing human chromosomal proteins HMG-14 and HMG-17 in
   bacterial cultures under the control of the temperature-inducible
   lambda-P(L) promoter have been constructed. The open reading frames of
   the cDNAs have been amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR),
   utilizing amplimers containing desired restriction sites, thereby
   facilitating precise location of the initiation codon downstream from a
   ribosomal binding site. Expression of the recombinant proteins does not
   significantly affect bacterial growth. The rate of synthesis of the
   recombinant proteins is maximal during the initial stages of induction
   and slows down appreciably with time. After an initial burst of protein
   synthesis, the level of the recombinant protein in the bacterial
   extracts remains constant at different times following induction.
   Methods for rapid extraction and purification of the recombinant
   proteins are described. The recombinant proteins are compared to the
   proteins isolated from eucaryotic cells by electrophoretic mobility,
   Western analysis and nucleosome core mobility-shift assays. The ability
   of the proteins to shift the mobility of the nucleosome cores, but not
   that of DNA, can be used as a functional assay for these HMG proteins. A
   source for large quantities of human chromosomal proteins HMG-14 and
   HMG-17 will facilitate studies on their structure, cellular function and
   mechanism of interaction with nucleosomes.},

Title = {Induction and Processing of the Radiation-Induced Gamma-H2AX Signal and
   Its Link to the Underlying Pattern of DSB: A Combined Experimental and
   Modelling Study},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {10},

Month = {JUN 11},
Abstract = {We present here an analysis of DSB induction and processing after
   irradiation with X-rays in an extended dose range based on the use of
   the gamma H2AX assay. The study was performed by quantitative flow
   cytometry measurements, since the use of foci counting would result in
   reasonable accuracy only in a limited dose range of a few Gy. The
   experimental data are complemented by a theoretical analysis based on
   the GLOBLE model. In fact, original aim of the study was to test GLOBLE
   predictions against new experimental data, in order to contribute to the
   validation of the model. Specifically, the gamma H2AX signal kinetics
   has been investigated up to 24 h after exposure to increasing photon
   doses between 2 and 500 Gy. The prolonged persistence of the signal at
   high doses strongly suggests dose dependence in DSB processing after low
   LET irradiation. Importantly, in the framework of our modelling
   analysis, this is related to a gradually increased fraction of DSB
   clustering at the micrometre scale. The parallel study of gamma H2AX
   dose response curves shows the onset of a pronounced saturation in two
   cell lines at a dose of about 20 Gy. This dose is much lower than
   expected according to model predictions based on the values usually
   adopted for the DSB induction yield (approximate to 30 DSB/Gy) and for
   the gamma H2AX foci extension of approximately 2 Mbp around the DSB. We
   show and discuss how theoretical predictions and experimental findings
   can be in principle reconciled by combining an increased DSB induction
   yield with the assumption of a larger genomic extension for the single
   phosphorylated regions. As an alternative approach, we also considered
   in our model the possibility of a 3D spreading-mechanism of the H2AX
   phosphorylation around the induced DSB, and applied it to the analysis
   of both the aspects considered. Our results are found to be supportive
   for the basic assumptions on which GLOBLE is built. Apart from giving
   new insights into the H2AX phosphorylation process, experiments
   performed at high doses are of relevance in the context of radiation
   therapy, where hypo-fractionated schemes become increasingly popular.},

Abstract = {Structure and function of bacterial nucleoid is controlled by the
   nucleoid-associated proteins (NAP). In any phase of growth, various
   NAPs, acting sequentially, condense nucleoid and facilitate formation of
   its transcriptionally active structure. However, in the late stationary
   phase, only one of the NAPs, Dps protein, is strongly expressed, and
   DNA-protein crystals are formed that transform nucleoid into a static,
   transcriptionally inactive structure, effectively protected from the
   external influences. Discovery of crystal structures in living cells and
   association of this phenomenon with the bacterial resistance to
   antibiotics has aroused great interest in studying this phenomenon. The
   aim of this work is to obtain and compare structures of two related NAPs
   (HU and IHF), since they are the ones that accumulate in the cell at the
   late stationary stage of growth, which precedes formation of the
   protective DNA-Dps crystalline complex. For structural studies, two
   complementary methods were used in the work: small-angle X-ray
   scattering (SAXS) as the main method for studying structure of proteins
   in solution, and dynamic light scattering as a complementary one. To
   interpret the SAXS data, various approaches and computer programs were
   used (in particular, the evaluation of structural invariants, rigid body
   modeling and equilibrium mixture analysis in terms of the volume
   fractions of its components were applied), which made it possible to
   determine macromolecular characteristics and obtain reliable 3D
   structural models of various oligomeric forms of HU and IHF proteins
   with similar to 2 nm resolution typical for SAXS. It was shown that
   these proteins oligomerize in solution to varying degrees, and IHF is
   characterized by the presence of large oligomers consisting of initial
   dimers arranged in a chain. An analysis of the experimental and
   published data made it possible to hypothesize that just before the Dps
   expression, it is IHF that forms toroidal structures previously observed
   in vivo and prepares the platform for formation of DNA-Dps crystals. The
   results obtained are necessary for further investigation of the
   phenomenon of biocrystal formation in bacterial cells and finding ways
   to overcome resistance of various pathogens to external conditions.},

Abstract = {Chitinase 3-like 1 (Chi3l1) is a secreted protein that is highly
   expressed in glioblastoma. Here, we show that Chi3l1 alters the state of
   glioma stem cells (GSC) to support tumor growth. Exposure of
   patient-derived GSCs to Chi3l1 reduced the frequency of CD133 thorn SOX2
   thorn cells and increased the CD44 thorn Chi3l1 thorn cells. Chi3l1
   bound to CD44 and induced phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of
   (3-catenin, Akt, and STAT3. Single-cell RNA sequencing and RNA velocity
   following incubation of GSCs with Chi3l1 showed significant changes in
   GSC state dynamics driving GSCs towards a mesenchymal expression profile
   and reducing transition probabilities towards terminal cellular states.
   ATAC-seq revealed that Chi3l1 increases accessibility of promoters
   containing a Myc-associated zinc finger protein (MAZ) transcription
   factor foot-print. Inhibition of MAZ downregulated a set of genes with
   high expression in cellular clusters that exhibit significant cell state
   transitions after treatment with Chi3l1, and MAZ deficiency rescued the
   Chi3L-induced increase of GSC self-renewal. Finally, targeting Chi3l1 in
   vivo with a blocking antibody inhibited tumor growth and increased the
   probability of survival. Overall, this work suggests that Chi3l1
   interacts with CD44 on the surface of GSCs to induce Akt/(3-catenin
   signaling and MAZ transcriptional activity, which in turn upregulates
   CD44 expression in a pro-mesenchymal feed-forward loop. The role of
   Chi3l1 in regulating cellular plasticity confers a targetable
   vulnerability to glioblastoma.Significance: Chi3l1 is a modulator of
   glioma stem cell states that can be targeted to promote differentiation
   and suppress growth of glioblastoma.},

Title = {Chromosome3D: reconstructing three-dimensional chromosomal structures
   from Hi-C interaction frequency data using distance geometry simulated
   annealing},
Journal = {BMC GENOMICS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {17},
Month = {NOV 7},
Abstract = {Background: Reconstructing three-dimensional structures of chromosomes
   is useful for visualizing their shapes in a cell and interpreting their
   function. In this work, we reconstruct chromosomal structures from Hi-C
   data by translating contact counts in Hi-C data into Euclidean distances
   between chromosomal regions and then satisfying these distances using a
   structure reconstruction method rigorously tested in the field of
   protein structure determination.
   Results: We first evaluate the robustness of the overall reconstruction
   algorithm on noisy simulated data at various levels of noise by
   comparing with some of the state-of-the-art reconstruction methods.
   Then, using simulated data, we validate that Spearman's rank correlation
   coefficient between pairwise distances in the reconstructed chromosomal
   structures and the experimental chromosomal contact counts can be used
   to find optimum conversion rules for transforming interaction
   frequencies to wish distances. This strategy is then applied to real
   Hi-C data at chromosome level for optimal transformation of interaction
   frequencies to wish distances and for ranking and selecting structures.
   The chromosomal structures reconstructed from a real-world human Hi-C
   dataset by our method were validated by the known two-compartment
   feature of the human chromosome organization. We also show that our
   method is robust with respect to the change of the granularity of Hi-C
   data, and consistently produces similar structures at different
   chromosomal resolutions.
   Conclusion: Chromosome3D is a robust method of reconstructing chromosome
   three-dimensional models using distance restraints obtained from Hi-C
   interaction frequency data. It is available as a web application and as
   an open source tool at http://sysbio.rnet.missouri.edu/chromosome3d/.},

Journal = {PLANT MOLECULAR BIOLOGY REPORTER},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {41},
Number = {4},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Adenylyl cyclase (AC) is an enzyme that catalyses the formation of the
   second messenger molecule, 3 \& PRIME;,5 \& PRIME;-cyclic adenosine
   monophosphate (cAMP) from 5 \& PRIME;-adenosine triphosphate (ATP).
   cAMP, in turn, regulates key physiological processes such as cell
   division, growth, reproduction, development and response to stress.
   However, while cAMP is increasingly becoming an important signalling
   molecule in higher plants, the identification of plant ACs has somewhat
   remained so slow. In Arabidopsis thaliana alone, only twelve ACs have so
   far been identified, yet considering the number and diverse nature of
   processes known to be cAMP-dependent in this plant, these identified ACs
   are still very much few to account for that. Notably, an additional
   protein in this plant, termed linker histone-like (AtLHL) protein
   (encoded by the At3g18035 gene), is annotated to be an AC as result of
   it containing a putative centre identical to the one commonly found in
   the other twelve previously confirmed Arabidopsis ACs. In addition,
   AtLHL is mostly involved in a number of key cellular processes such as
   heterochromatin formation, DNA repair, apoptosis, embryogenesis,
   reproduction and disease resistance that are all modulated by cAMP, yet
   AtLHL still remains unconfirmed as an AC. As a result, we targeted this
   protein in this study to determine if it is indeed an AC. To begin with,
   we used computational analysis to assess the 3-dimensional (3D)
   structure of AtLHL and found that its AC centre is solvent-exposed,
   amenable to the unhindered access of ATP as a substrate for catalysis.
   Next, we cloned, partially expressed and affinity purified a truncated
   version of this protein (AtLHL301-480), followed by assessment of its
   probable AC activity. Through enzyme immunoassay and mass spectrometry,
   we showed that the recombinant AtLHL301-480 protein can generate cAMP
   from ATP in vitro in a manganese-dependent manner that is enhanced by
   calcium and hydrogen carbonate. In addition, we also showed that the
   recombinant AtLHL301-480 protein can complement AC-deficiency (cyaA
   mutation) in SP850 cells when expressed in this mutant Escherichia coli
   host strain. We then used electrochemistry to evaluate the molecular
   interaction of AtLHL301-480 with its co-factors and modulators during
   catalysis and activation, respectively, and found that the protein does
   this physically. This observation then prompted us to specifically
   search for the presence (and possibly frequency) of calcium-binding
   sites within the AtLHL protein. Through in silico analysis and
   bioinformatic studies, a single binding site in form of a 16-residue
   calmodulin-binding sequence was predicted. Lastly, we then evaluated the
   reaction kinetics of AtLHL301-480 and determined that the protein has a
   K-m constant of 0.7 mM and a V-max constant of 9.2 fmol/min/\& mu;g
   protein. All in all, our study provided adequate evidence in a
   multi-faceted manner that LHL from A. thaliana is a bona fide AC, whose
   activity might be involved in control and molecular regulation of the
   various functions of this protein in this plant.},

Abstract = {The organization of animal genomes into topologically associating
   domains (TADs) provides a structural scaffold in which cis-regulatory
   elements (CREs) operate on their target genes. Determining the position
   of CREs and genes relative to TADs has become instrumental to trace gene
   expression changes during evolution and in diseases. Here we will review
   recent studies and discuss TADs as structural units with respect to
   their conservation and stability during genome reorganization.
   Furthermore, we describe how TAD restructuring contributed to
   morphological novelties during evolution but also their deleterious
   effects associated with disease. Despite considering TADs as structural
   units, the nested and dynamic scaffold within TADs contributes to
   tissue-specific gene expression, implying that such changes can also
   account for gene expression differences during evolution.},

Abstract = {Structure-based drug discovery (SBDD) largely relies on structural
   information from X-ray crystallography because tradi-tional NMR
   structure calculation methods are too time consuming tobe aligned with

   generate ligand-protein complexstructures using published structures
   (apo or holo) of the targetprotein and treating all observed NOEs as
   ambiguous restraints,bypassing the laborious process of obtaining
   sequence-specificresonance assignments for the protein target. We apply
   this methodto two therapeutic targets, the bromodomain of TRIM24 and
   thesecond bromodomain of BRD4. We show that theNMR2method-ology can
   guide SBDD by rationalizing the observed SAR. We alsodemonstrate that
   new types of restraints and selective methyl labeling have the potential
   to dramatically reduce{''}time to structure{''}and extend the method to

Title = {A Specific Function for the Histone Chaperone NASP to Fine-Tune a
   Reservoir of Soluble H3-H4 in the Histone Supply Chain},
Journal = {MOLECULAR CELL},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {44},
Number = {6},
Pages = {918-927},
Month = {DEC 23},
Abstract = {Proper genome packaging requires coordination of both DNA and histone
   metabolism. While histone gene transcription and RNA processing
   adequately provide for scheduled needs, how histone supply adjusts to
   unexpected changes in demand remains unknown. Here, we reveal that the
   histone chaperone nuclear autoantigenic sperm protein (NASP) protects a
   reservoir of soluble histones H3-H4. The importance of NASP is revealed
   upon histone overload, engagement of the reservoir during acute
   replication stress, and perturbation of Asf1 activity. The reservoir can
   be fine-tuned, increasing or decreasing depending on the level of NASP.
   Our data suggest that NASP does so by balancing the activity of the heat
   shock proteins Hsc70 and Hsp90 to direct H3-H4 for degradation by
   chaperone-mediated autophagy. These insights into NASP function and the
   existence of a tunable reservoir in mammalian cells demonstrate that
   contingency is integrated into the histone supply chain to respond to
   unexpected changes in demand.},

Abstract = {We are witnessing tremendous advances in our understanding of the
   organization of life. Complete genomes are being deciphered with ever
   increasing speed and accuracy, thereby setting the stage for addressing
   the entire gene product repertoire of cells, towards understanding whole
   biological systems. Advances in bioinformatics and mass spectrometric
   techniques have revealed the multitude of interactions present in the
   proteome. Multiprotein complexes are emerging as a paramount cornerstone
   of biological activity, as many proteins appear to participate, stably
   or transiently, in large multisubunit assemblies. Analysis of the
   architecture of these assemblies and their manifold interactions is
   imperative for understanding their function at the molecular level.
   Structural genomics efforts have fostered the development of many
   technologies towards achieving the throughput required for studying
   system-wide single proteins and small interaction motifs at high
   resolution. The present shift in focus towards large multiprotein
   complexes, in particular in eukaryotes, now calls for a likewise
   concerted effort to develop and provide new technologies that are
   urgently required to produce in quality and quantity the plethora of
   multiprotein assemblies that form the complexome, and to routinely study
   their structure and function at the molecular level. Current efforts
   towards this objective are summarized and reviewed in this contribution.},

Abstract = {We describe a newly discovered nuclear protein, HMGN4, that is closely
   related to the canonical HMGN2 nucleosome-binding protein. The protein
   is encoded by an intronless gene, which, in humans, is located in the
   hereditary hemachromatosis region at position 6p21.3, A single similar
   to2-kb HMGN4 mRNA was found to be expressed, in variable amounts, in all
   human tissues tested; however, the HMGN4 transcript was significantly
   less abundant than that of HMGN2, The HMGN4 protein could be detected in
   HeLa cells by Western analysis with an antibody elicited against a
   unique region of the protein. Transfection of HeLa cells with a plasmid
   expressing HMGN4-GFP indicated that the protein localizes to the
   nucleus. Our results expand the multiplicity of the HMGN protein family
   and increase the known cellular repertoire of nucleosome-binding
   proteins.},

Title = {Theoretically exploring selective-binding mechanisms of BRD4 through

Journal = {SAR AND QSAR IN ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH},

Pages = {985-1011},
Abstract = {The origin of cancer is related to the dysregulation of multiple signal
   pathways and of physiological processes. Bromodomain-containing protein
   4 (BRD4) has become an attractive target for the development of
   anticancer and anti-inflammatory agents since it can epigenetically
   regulate the transcription of growth-promoting genes. The synthesized
   BRD4 inhibitors with new chemical structures can reduce the drug
   resistance, but their binding modes and the inhibitory mechanism remain
   unclear. Here, we initially constructed robust QSAR models based on 68
   reported tetrahydropteridin analogues using topomer CoMFA and HQSAR. On
   the basis of QSAR results, we designed 16 novel tetrahydropteridin
   analogues with modified structures and carried out docking studies.
   Instead of significant hydrogen bondings with amino acid residue Asn140
   as reported in previous research, the molecular docking modelling
   suggested a novel docking pose that involves the amino acid residues
   (Trp81, Pro82, Va187, Leu92, Leu94, Cys136, Asp144, and lle146) at the
   active site of BRD4. The MD simulations, free energy calculations, and
   residual energy contributions all indicate that hydrophobic interactions
   are decisive factors affecting bindings between inhibitors and BRD4. The
   current study provides new insights that can aid the discovery of BRD4
   inhibitors with enhanced anti-cancer ability.},

Title = {MethHaplo: combining allele-specific DNA methylation and SNPs for
   haplotype region identification},
Journal = {BMC BIOINFORMATICS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {21},

Month = {OCT 12},
Abstract = {Background DNA methylation is an important epigenetic modification that
   plays a critical role in most eukaryotic organisms. Parental alleles in
   haploid genomes may exhibit different methylation patterns, which can
   lead to different phenotypes and even different therapeutic and drug
   responses to diseases. However, to our knowledge, no software is
   available for the identification of DNA methylation haplotype regions
   with combined allele-specific DNA methylation, single nucleotide
   polymorphisms (SNPs) and high-throughput chromosome conformation capture
   (Hi-C) data. Results In this paper, we developed a new method,
   MethHaplo, that identify DNA methylation haplotype regions with
   allele-specific DNA methylation and SNPs from whole-genome bisulfite
   sequencing (WGBS) data. Our results showed that methylation haplotype
   regions were ten times longer than haplotypes with SNPs only. When we
   integrate WGBS and Hi-C data, MethHaplo could call even longer
   haplotypes. Conclusions This study illustrates the usefulness of
   methylation haplotypes. By constructing methylation haplotypes for
   various cell lines, we provide a clearer picture of the effect of DNA
   methylation on gene expression, histone modification and
   three-dimensional chromosome structure at the haplotype level. Our
   method could benefit the study of parental inheritance-related disease
   and hybrid vigor in agriculture.},

Abstract = {The 2021 Summer Biomechanics, Bioengineering, and Biotransport
   Conference (SB3C) featured a workshop titled ``The Elephant in the Room:
   Nuclear Mechanics and Mechanobiology.{''} The goal of this workshop was
   to provide a perspective from experts in the field on the current
   understanding of nuclear mechanics and its role in mechanobiology. This
   paper reviews the major themes and questions discussed during the
   workshop, including historical context on the initial methods of
   measuring the mechanical properties of the nucleus and classifying the
   primary structures dictating nuclear mechanics, physical plasticity of
   the nucleus, the emerging role of the linker of nucleoskeleton and
   cytoskeleton (LINC) complex in coupling the nucleus to the cytoplasm and
   driving the behavior of individual cells and multicellular assemblies,
   and the computational models currently in use to investigate the
   mechanisms of gene expression and cell signaling. Ongoing questions and
   controversies, along with promising future directions, are also
   discussed.},

Abstract = {Recent studies indicate that even a homogeneous population of cells
   display heterogeneity in gene expression and response to environmental
   stimuli. Although promoter structure critically influences the
   cell-to-cell variation of gene expression in bacteria and lower
   eukaryotes, it remains unclear what controls the gene expression noise
   in mammals. Here we report that CTCF decreases cell-to-cell variation of
   expression by stabilizing enhancer-promoter interaction. We show that
   CTCF binding sites are interwoven with enhancers within topologically
   associated domains (TADs) and a positive correlation is found between
   CTCF binding and the activity of the associated enhancers. Deletion of
   CTCF sites compromises enhancer-promoter interactions. Using single-cell
   flow cytometry and single-molecule RNA-FISH assays, we demonstrate that
   knocking down of CTCF or deletion of a CTCF binding site results in
   increased cell-to-cell variation of gene expression, indicating that
   long-range promoter-enhancer interaction mediated by CTCF plays
   important roles in controlling the cell-to-cell variation of gene
   expression in mammalian cells.},

Abstract = {Changes of nuclear localization of lineage-specific genes from a
   transcriptionally inert to permissive environment are a crucial step in
   establishing the identity of a cell. Noncoding RNA
   transcription-mediated genome folding and activation of target gene
   expression have been found in a variety of cell types. Noncoding RNA
   ThymoD (thymocyte differentiation factor) transcription at
   superenhancers is essential for mouse T-cell lineage commitment. The
   cessation of ThymoD transcription abolishes transcription-mediated
   demethylation, recruiting looping factors such as the cohesin complex,
   CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF), ultimately leading to the phenotype of
   severe combined immunodeficiency and T-cell leukemia/lymphoma. In this
   review, we describe the functional role of RNA polymerase II-mediated
   transcription at enhancers and in genome folding. We also highlight the
   involvement of faulty activation or suppression of enhancer
   transcription and enhancer-promoter interaction in cancer development.},

Abstract = {The four-dimensional nucleome (4DN) consortium studies the architecture
   of the genome and the nucleus in space and time. We summarize progress
   by the consortium and highlight the development of technologies for (1)
   mapping genome folding and identifying roles of nuclear components and
   bodies, proteins, and RNA, (2) characterizing nuclear organization with
   time or single-cell resolution, and (3) imaging of nuclear organization.
   With these tools, the consortium has provided over 2,000 public
   datasets. Integrative computational models based on these data are
   starting to reveal connections between genome structure and function. We
   then present a forward-looking perspective and outline current aims to
   (1) delineate dynamics of nuclear architecture at different timescales,
   from minutes to weeks as cells differentiate, in populations and in
   single cells, (2) char-acterize cis-determinants and trans-modulators of
   genome organization, (3) test functional consequences of changes in cis-
   and trans-regulators, and (4) develop predictive models of genome
   structure and function.},

Abstract = {Ibrutinib exerts promising anticancer effects in chronic lymphocytic
   leukaemia (CLL). However, acquired resistance occurs during treatment,
   necessitating the exploration of underlying mechanisms. Although
   three-dimensional genome organization has been identified as a major
   player in the development and progression of cancer, including drug
   resistance, little is known regarding its role in CLL. Therefore, we
   investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying ibrutinib resistance
   through multi-omics analysis, including high-throughput chromosome
   conformation capture (Hi-C) technology. We demonstrated that the
   therapeutic response to ibrutinib is associated with the expression of
   p21-activated kinase 1 (PAK1). PAK1, which was up-regulated in CLL and
   associated with patients' survival, was involved in cell proliferation,
   glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation. Furthermore, the PAK1
   inhibitor IPA-3 exerted an anti-tumour effect and its combination with
   ibrutinib exhibited a synergistic effect in ibrutinib-sensitive and
   -resistant cells. These findings suggest the oncogenic role of PAK1 in
   CLL progression and drug resistance, highlighting PAK1 as a potential
   diagnostic marker and therapeutic target in CLL including
   ibrutinib-resistant CLL.},

Abstract = {Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CdLS) is a complex multisystem developmental
   disorder caused by mutations in cohesin subunits and regulators. While
   its precise molecular mechanisms are not well defined, they point toward
   a global deregulation of the transcriptional gene expression program.
   Cohesin is associated with the boundaries of chromosome domains and with
   enhancer and promoter regions connecting the three-dimensional genome
   organization with transcriptional regulation. Here, we show that
   connected gene communities, structures emerging from the interactions of
   noncoding regulatory elements and genes in the three-dimensional
   chromosomal space, provide a molecular explanation for the pathoetiology
   of CdLS associated with mutations in the cohesin-loading factor NIPBL
   and the cohesin subunit SMC1A. NIPBL and cohesin are important
   constituents of connected gene communities that are centrally positioned
   at noncoding regulatory elements. Accordingly, genes deregulated in CdLS
   are positioned within reach of NIPBL- and cohesin-occupied regions
   through promoter-promoter interactions. Our findings suggest a dynamic
   model where NIPBL loads cohesin to connect genes in communities,
   offering an explanation for the gene expression deregulation in the
   CdLS.},

Journal = {NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS},
Year = {2014},

Abstract = {DNA is known to be a mechanically and thermally stable structure. In its
   double stranded form it is densely packed within the cell nucleus and is
   thermo-resistant up to 70 degrees C. In contrast, we found a sudden loss
   of cell nuclei integrity at relatively moderate temperatures ranging
   from 45 to 55 degrees C. In our study, suspended cells held in an
   optical double beam trap were heated under controlled conditions while
   monitoring the nuclear shape. At specific critical temperatures, an
   irreversible sudden shape transition of the nuclei was observed. These
   temperature induced transitions differ in abundance and intensity for
   various normal and cancerous epithelial breast cells, which clearly
   characterizes different cell types. Our results show that temperatures
   slightly higher than physiological conditions are able to induce
   instabilities of nuclear structures, eventually leading to cell death.
   This is a surprising finding since recent thermorheological cell studies
   have shown that cells have a lower viscosity and are thus more
   deformable upon temperature increase. Since the nucleus is tightly
   coupled to the outer cell shape via the cytoskeleton, the force
   propagation of nuclear reshaping to the cell membrane was investigated
   in combination with the application of cytoskeletal drugs.},

Abstract = {Long interspersed element -1 (LINE -1 or L1) comprises 17\% of the human
   genome, continuously generates genetic variations, and causes disease in
   certain cases. However, the regulation and function of L1 remain poorly
   understood. Here, we uncover that L1 can enrich RNA polymerase IIs (RNA
   Pol IIs), express L1 chimeric transcripts, and create contact domain
   boundaries in human cells. This impact of L1 is restricted by a nuclear
   matrix protein scaffold attachment factor B (SAFB) that recognizes
   transcriptionally active L1s by binding L1 transcripts to inhibit RNA
   Pol II enrichment. Acute inhibition of RNA Pol II transcription
   abolishes the domain boundaries associated with L1 chimeric transcripts,
   indicating a transcription -dependent mechanism. Deleting L1 impairs
   domain boundary formation, and L1 insertions during evolution have
   introduced species -specific domain boundaries. Our data show that L1
   can create RNA Pol II -enriched regions that alter genome organization
   and that SAFB regulates L1 and RNA Pol II activity to preserve gene
   regulation.},

Title = {CaMKIIβ deregulation contributes to neuromuscular junction
   destabilization in Myotonic Dystrophy type I},
Journal = {SKELETAL MUSCLE},
Year = {2024},

Abstract = {Background Myotonic Dystrophy type I (DM1) is the most common muscular
   dystrophy in adults. Previous reports have highlighted that
   neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) deteriorate in skeletal muscle from DM1
   patients and mouse models thereof. However, the underlying
   pathomechanisms and their contribution to muscle dysfunction remain
   unknown.Methods We compared changes in NMJs and activity-dependent
   signalling pathways in HSA LR and Mbnl1 Delta E3/Delta E3 mice, two
   established mouse models of DM1.Results Muscle from DM1 mouse models
   showed major deregulation of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein
   kinases II (CaMKIIs), which are key activity sensors regulating synaptic
   gene expression and acetylcholine receptor (AChR) recycling at the NMJ.
   Both mouse models exhibited increased fragmentation of the endplate,
   which preceded muscle degeneration. Endplate fragmentation was not
   accompanied by changes in AChR turnover at the NMJ. However, the
   expression of synaptic genes was up-regulated in mutant innervated
   muscle, together with an abnormal accumulation of histone deacetylase 4
   (HDAC4), a known target of CaMKII. Interestingly, denervation-induced
   increase in synaptic gene expression and AChR turnover was hampered in
   DM1 muscle. Importantly, CaMKII beta/beta M overexpression normalized
   endplate fragmentation and synaptic gene expression in innervated Mbnl1
   Delta E3/Delta E3 muscle, but it did not restore denervation-induced
   synaptic gene up-regulation.Conclusions Our results indicate that CaMKII
   beta-dependent and -independent mechanisms perturb synaptic gene
   regulation and muscle response to denervation in DM1 mouse models.
   Changes in these signalling pathways may contribute to NMJ
   destabilization and muscle dysfunction in DM1 patients.},

Abstract = {The nuclear lamina is a key structural element of the metazoan nucleus.
   However, the structural organization of the major proteins composing the
   lamina is poorly defined. Using three-dimensional structured
   illumination microscopy and computational image analysis, we
   characterized the supramolecular structures of lamin A, C, B1, and B2 in
   mouse embryo fibroblast nuclei. Each isoform forms a distinct fiber
   meshwork, with comparable physical characteristics with respect to mesh
   edge length, mesh face area and shape, and edge connectivity to form
   faces. Some differences were found in face areas among isoforms due to
   variation in the edge lengths and number of edges per face, suggesting
   that each meshwork has somewhat unique assembly characteristics. In
   fibroblasts null for the expression of either lamins A/C or lamin B1,
   the remaining lamin meshworks are altered compared with the lamin
   meshworks in wild-type nuclei or nuclei lacking lamin B2. Nuclei lacking
   LA/C exhibit slightly enlarged meshwork faces and some shape changes,
   whereas LB1-deficient nuclei exhibit primarily a substantial increase in
   face area. These studies demonstrate that individual lamin isoforms
   assemble into complex networks within the nuclear lamina and that A-and
   B-type lamins have distinct roles in maintaining the organization of the
   nuclear lamina.},

Abstract = {B cell development depends on the coordinated expression and cooperation
   of several transcription factors. Here we show that the transcription
   factor ETS-related gene (ERG) is crucial for normal B cell development
   and that its deletion results in a substantial loss of bone marrow B
   cell progenitors and peripheral B cells, as well as a skewing of splenic
   B cell populations. We find that ERG-deficient B lineage cells exhibit
   an early developmental block at the pre-B cell stage and proliferate
   less. The cells fail to express the immunoglobulin heavy chain due to
   inefficient V-to-DJ recombination, and cells that undergo recombination
   display a strong bias against incorporation of distal V gene segments.
   Furthermore, antisense transcription at PAX5-activated intergenic repeat
   (PAIR) elements, located in the distal region of the Igh locus, depends
   on ERG. These findings show that ERG serves as a critical regulator of B
   cell development by ensuring efficient and balanced V-to-DJ
   recombination.},

Abstract = {Deletions that fuse two adjacent topologically associating domains
   (TADs) can cause severe developmental disorders. We provide a formal
   method to quantify deletions based on their potential disruption of the
   three-dimensional genome structure, denoted as the TAD fusion score.
   Furthermore, we show that deletions that cause TAD fusion are rare and
   under negative selection in the general population. Finally, we show
   that our method correctly gives higher scores to deletions reported to
   cause various disorders, including developmental disorders and cancer,
   in comparison to the deletions reported in the 1000 Genomes Project. The
   TAD fusion score tool is publicly available at

Title = {Enhancers of the PAIR4 regulatory module promote distal V<sub>H</sub>
   gene recombination at the <i>Igh</i> locus},

Abstract = {While extended loop extrusion across the entire Igh locus controls
   V-H-DJ(H) recombination, local regulatory sequences, such as the PAIR
   elements, may also activate V-H gene recombination in pro-B-cells. Here,
   we show that PAIR-associated V(H)8 genes contain a conserved putative
   regulatory element (V8E) in their downstream sequences. To investigate
   the function of PAIR4 and its V8.7E, we deleted 890 kb containing all 14
   PAIRs in the Igh 5 ` region, which reduced distal V-H gene recombination
   over a 100-kb distance on either side of the deletion. Reconstitution by
   insertion of PAIR4-V8.7E strongly activated distal V-H gene
   recombination. PAIR4 alone resulted in lower induction of recombination,
   indicating that PAIR4 and V8.7E function as one regulatory unit. The
   pro-B-cell-specific activity of PAIR4 depends on CTCF, as mutation of
   its CTCF-binding site led to sustained PAIR4 activity in pre-B and
   immature B-cells and to PAIR4 activation in T-cells. Notably, insertion
   of V8.8E was sufficient to activate V-H gene recombination. Hence,
   enhancers of the PAIR4-V8.7E module and V8.8E element activate distal
   V-H gene recombination and thus contribute to the diversification of the
   BCR repertoire in the context of loop extrusion.},

Abstract = {The nonrandom positioning of chromosome territories in eukaryotic cells
   is largely correlated with gene density and is conserved throughout
   evolution. Gene-rich chromosomes are predominantly central, while
   gene-poor chromosomes are peripherally localized in interphase nuclei.
   We previously demonstrated that artificially introduced human
   chromosomes assume a position equivalent to their endogenous homologues
   in the diploid colon cancer cell line DLD-1. These chromosomal
   aneuploidies result in a significant increase in transcript levels,
   suggesting a relationship between genomic copy number, gene expression,
   and chromosome position. We previously proposed that each chromosome is
   marked by a ``zip code{''} that determines its nonrandom position in the
   nucleus. In this paper, we investigated (1) whether mouse nuclei
   recognize such determinants of nuclear position on human chromosomes to
   facilitate their distinct partitioning and (2) if chromosome positioning
   and transcriptional activity remain coupled under these trans-species
   conditions. Using three-dimensional fluorescence in situ hybridization,
   confocal microscopy, and gene expression profiling, we show (1) that
   gene-poor and gene-rich human chromosomes maintain their divergent but
   conserved positions in mouse-human hybrid nuclei and (2) that a foreign
   human chromosome is actively transcribed in mouse nuclei. Our results
   suggest a species-independent conserved mechanism for the nonrandom
   positioning of chromosomes in the three-dimensional interphase nucleus.},

Abstract = {Both type 1 and type 2 diabetes involve a complex interplay between
   genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors. Our laboratory has been
   interested in the physical interactions, in nuclei of human pancreatic
   beta cells, between the insulin (INS) gene and other genes that are
   involved in insulin metabolism. We have identified, using Circularized
   Chromosome Conformation Capture (4C), many physical contacts in a human
   pancreatic beta cell line between the INS promoter on chromosome 11 and
   sites on most other chromosomes. Many of these contacts are associated
   with type 1 or type 2 diabetes susceptibility loci. To determine whether
   physical contact is correlated with an ability of the INS locus to
   affect expression of these genes, we knock down INS expression by
   targeting the promoter; 259 genes are either up or down-regulated. Of
   these, 46 make physical contact with INS. We analyze a subset of the
   contacted genes and show that all are associated with acetylation of
   histone H3 lysine 27, a marker of actively expressed genes. To
   demonstrate the usefulness of this approach in revealing regulatory
   pathways, we identify from among the contacted sites the previously
   uncharacterized gene SSTR5-AS1 and show that it plays an important role
   in controlling the effect of somatostatin-28 on insulin secretion. These
   results are consistent with models in which clustering of genes supports
   transcriptional activity. This may be a particularly important mechanism
   in pancreatic beta cells and in other cells where a small subset of
   genes is expressed at high levels.},

Abstract = {Over the past decade, methods for predicting three-dimensional (3-D)
   chromosome and genome structures have proliferated. This has been
   primarily due to the development of high-throughput, next-generation
   chromosome conformation capture (3C) technologies, which have provided
   next-generation sequencing data about chromosome conformations in order
   to map the 3-D genome structure. The introduction of the Hi-C techniquea
   variant of the 3C methodhas allowed researchers to extract the
   interaction frequency (IF) for all loci of a genome at high-throughput
   and at a genome-wide scale. In this review we describe, categorize, and
   compare the various methods developed to map chromosome and genome
   structures from 3C dataparticularly Hi-C data. We summarize the
   improvements introduced by these methods, describe the approach used for
   method evaluation, and discuss how these advancements shape the future
   of genome structure construction.},

Abstract = {Over the past decade, 3C-related methods have provided remarkable
   insights into chromosome folding in vivo. To overcome the limited
   resolution of prior studies, we extend a recently developed Hi-C
   variant, Micro-C, to map chromosome architecture at nucleosome
   resolution in human ESCs and fibroblasts. Micro-C robustly captures
   known features of chromosome folding including compartment organization,
   topologically associating domains, and interactions between CTCF binding
   sites. In addition, Micro-C provides a detailed map of nucleosome
   positions and localizes contact domain boundaries with nucleosomal
   precision. Compared to Hi-C, Micro-C exhibits an order of magnitude
   greater dynamic range, allowing the identification of similar to 20,000
   additional loops in each cell type. Many newly identified peaks are
   localized along extrusion stripes and form transitive grids, consistent
   with their anchors being pause sites impeding cohesin-dependent loop
   extrusion. Our analyses comprise the highest-resolution maps of
   chromosome folding in human cells to date, providing a valuable resource
   for studies of chromosome organization.},

Abstract = {Spatial positioning of pericentric chromosome regions in human
   lymphocyte cell nuclei was investigated during repair after
   H2O2/L-histidine treatment. Fifteen to three-hundred minutes after
   treatment, these regions of chromosomes 1, 15, and X were labeled by
   fluorescence in situ hybridization. The relative locus distances
   (LL-distances), the relative distances to the nuclear center
   (LC-distances), and the locus-nuclear center-locus angles (LCL-angles)
   were measured in; 5000 nuclei after two-dimensional microscopy.
   Experimental frequency histograms were compared to control data from
   untreated stimulated and quiescent (G(0)) nuclei and to a theoretical
   two-dimensional projection from random points. Based on the frequency
   distributions of the LL-distances and the LCL-angles, an increase of
   closely associated labeled regions was found shortly after repair
   activation. For longer repair times this effect decreased. After 300 min
   the frequency distribution of the LL-distances was found to be
   compatible with the random distance distribution again. The LL-distance
   frequency histograms for quiescent nuclei did not significantly differ
   from the theoretical random distribution, although this was the case for
   the stimulated control of chromosomes 15 and X. It may be inferred that,
   concerning the distances, homologous pericentric regions appear not to
   be randomly distributed during S-phase, and are subjected to dynamic
   processes during replication and repair.},

Abstract = {Sections from archival formalin-fixed, paraffin wax-embedded human
   tissues are a valuable source for the study of the nuclear architecture
   of specific tissue types in terms of the three-dimensional spatial
   positioning and architecture of chromosome territories and
   sub-chromosomal domains. Chromosome painting, centromeric, and
   locus-specific probes were hybridized to tissue microarrays prepared
   from formalin-fixed paraffin wax-embedded samples of pancreas and
   breast. The cell nuclei were analyzed using quantitative
   three-dimensional image microscopy. The results obtained from
   non-neoplastic pancreatic cells of randomly selected individuals
   indicated that the radial arrangement of the chromosome 8 territories as
   well as their shape (roundness) did not significantly differ between the
   individuals and were in accordance with assumptions of a probabilistic
   model for computer simulations. There were considerable differences
   between pancreatic tumor and non-neoplastic cells. In non-neoplastic
   ductal epithelium of the breast there was a larger, but insignificant,
   variability in the three-dimensional positioning of the centromere 17
   and HER2 domains between individuals. In neoplastic epithelial breast
   cells, however, the distances between centromere and gene domains were,
   on average, smaller than in non-neoplastic cells. In conclusion, our
   results demonstrate the feasibility of studying the genome architecture
   in archival, formalin-fixed, paraffin wax-embedded human tissues,
   opening new directions in tumor research and cell classification.},

Title = {Imaging the dynamics of transcription loops in living chromosomes},
Journal = {CHROMOSOMA},

Volume = {127},

Pages = {361-374},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {When in the lampbrush configuration, chromosomes display thousands of
   visible DNA loops that are transcribed at exceptionally high rates by
   RNA polymerase II (pol II). These transcription loops provide unique
   opportunities to investigate not only the detailed architecture of pol
   II transcription sites but also the structural dynamics of chromosome
   looping, which is receiving fresh attention as the organizational
   principle underpinning the higher-order structure of all chromosome
   states. The approach described here allows for extended imaging of
   individual transcription loops and transcription units under conditions
   in which loop RNA synthesis continues. In intact nuclei from
   lampbrush-stage Xenopus oocytes isolated under mineral oil, highly
   specific targeting of fluorescent fusions of the RNA-binding protein
   CELF1 to nascent transcripts allowed functional transcription loops to
   be observed and their longevity assessed over time. Some individual
   loops remained extended and essentially static structures over time
   courses of up to an hour. However, others were less stable and shrank
   markedly over periods of 30-60 min in a manner that suggested that loop
   extension requires continued dense coverage with nascent transcripts. In
   stable loops and loop-derived structures, the molecular dynamics of the
   visible nascent RNP component were addressed using photokinetic
   approaches. The results suggested that CELF1 exchanges freely between
   the accumulated nascent RNP and the surrounding nucleoplasm, and that it
   exits RNP with similar kinetics to its entrance. Overall, it appears
   that on transcription loops, nascent transcripts contribute to a dynamic
   self-organizing structure that exemplifies a phase-separated nuclear
   compartment.},

Title = {Electron microscopy analysis of ATP-independent nucleosome unfolding by
   FACT},
Journal = {COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {5},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 10},
Abstract = {Sivkina et al. present a biochemical and biophysical characterization of
   the interaction of S. cerevisiae histone chaperone FACT with the
   nucleosome core particle. They show that FACT adopts a more open
   geometry in the presence of Nhp6, and together they unfold nucleosomes
   to an almost extended conformation, suggesting a mechanism for
   FACT-facilitated disassembly of nucleosomes.
   FACT is a histone chaperone that participates in nucleosome removal and
   reassembly during transcription and replication. We used electron
   microscopy to study FACT, FACT:Nhp6 and FACT:Nhp6:nucleosome complexes,
   and found that all complexes adopt broad ranges of configurations,
   indicating high flexibility. We found unexpectedly that the DNA binding
   protein Nhp6 also binds to the C-terminal tails of FACT subunits,
   inducing more open geometries of FACT even in the absence of
   nucleosomes. Nhp6 therefore supports nucleosome unfolding by altering
   both the structure of FACT and the properties of nucleosomes. Complexes
   formed with FACT, Nhp6, and nucleosomes also produced a broad range of
   structures, revealing a large number of potential intermediates along a
   proposed unfolding pathway. The data suggest that Nhp6 has multiple
   roles before and during nucleosome unfolding by FACT, and that the
   process proceeds through a series of energetically similar intermediate
   structures, ultimately leading to an extensively unfolded form.},

Title = {Monitoring the Rate and Dynamics of Concerted Evolution in the Ribosomal
   DNA Repeats of <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> Using Experimental
   Evolution},
Journal = {MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2011},

Abstract = {Concerted evolution describes the unusual evolutionary pattern exhibited
   by certain repetitive sequences, whereby all the repeats are maintained
   in the genome with very similar sequences but differ between related
   species. The pattern of concerted evolution is thought to result from
   continual turnover of repeats by recombination, a process known as
   homogenization. Approaches to studying concerted evolution have largely
   been observational because of difficulties investigating repeat
   evolution in an experimental setting with large arrays of identical
   repeats. Here, we establish an experimental evolution approach to look
   at the rate and dynamics of concerted evolution in the ribosomal DNA
   (rDNA) repeats. A small targeted mutation was made in the spacer of a
   single rDNA unit in Saccharomyces cerevisiae so we could monitor the
   fate of this unit without the need for a selectable marker. The rate of
   loss of this single unit was determined, and the frequency of
   duplication was also estimated. The results show that duplication and
   deletion events occur at similar rates and are very common: An rDNA unit
   may be gained or lost as frequently as once every cell division.
   Investigation of the spatial dynamics of rDNA turnover showed that when
   the tagged repeat unit was duplicated, the copy predominantly, but not
   exclusively, ended up near to the tagged repeat. This suggests that
   variants in the rDNA spread in a semiclustered fashion. Surprisingly,
   large deletions that remove a significant fraction of total rDNA repeats
   were frequently found. We propose these large deletions are a driving
   force of concerted evolution, acting to increase homogenization
   efficiency over-and-above that afforded by turnover of individual rDNA
   units. Thus, the results presented here enhance our understanding of
   concerted evolution by offering insights into both the spatial and
   temporal dynamics of the homogenization process and suggest an important
   new aspect in our understanding of concerted evolution.},

   Moss <i>Physcomitrium patens</i>},
Journal = {CELL REPORTS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {32},
Number = {10},
Month = {SEP 8},
Abstract = {Shoot formation is accompanied by active cell proliferation and
   expansion, requiring that metabolic state adapts to developmental
   control. Despite the importance of such metabolic reprogramming, it
   remains unclear how development and metabolism are integrated. Here, we
   show that disruption of ANGUSTIFOLIA3 orthologs (PpAN3s) compromises
   gametophore shoot formation in the moss Physcomitrium patens due to
   defective cell proliferation and expansion. Trans-omics analysis reveals
   that the downstream activity of PpAN3 is linked to arginine metabolism.
   Elevating arginine level by chemical treatment leads to stunted
   gametophores and causes Ppan3 mutant-like transcriptional changes in the
   wild-type plant. Furthermore, ectopic expression of AtAN3 from
   Arabidopsis thaliana ameliorates the defective arginine metabolism and
   promotes gametophore formation in Ppan3 mutants. Together, these
   findings indicate that arginine metabolism is a key pathway associated
   with gametophore formation and provide evolutionary insights into the
   establishment of the shoot system in land plants through the integration
   of developmental and metabolic processes.},

Title = {Protection of the genome and the central exome by peripheral non-coding
   DNA against DNA damage in health, ageing and age-related diseases},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 SEP 26},
Abstract = {DNA in eukaryotic genomes is under constant assault from both exogenous
   and endogenous sources, leading to DNA damage, which is considered a
   major molecular driver of ageing. Fortunately, the genome and the
   central exome are safeguarded against these attacks by abundant
   peripheral non-coding DNA. Non-coding DNA codes for small non-coding
   RNAs that inactivate foreign nucleic acids in the cytoplasm and
   physically blocks these attacks in the nucleus. Damage to non-coding DNA
   produced during such blockage is removed in the form of extrachromosomal
   circular DNA (eccDNA) through nucleic pore complexes. Consequently,
   non-coding DNA serves as a line of defence for the exome against DNA
   damage. The total amount of non-coding DNA/heterochromatin declines with
   age, resulting in a decrease in both physical blockage and eccDNA
   exclusion, and thus an increase in the accumulation of DNA damage in the
   nucleus during ageing and in age-related diseases. Here, we summarize
   recent evidence supporting a protective role of non-coding DNA in
   healthy and pathological states and argue that DNA damage is the
   proximate cause of ageing and age-related genetic diseases. Strategies
   aimed at strengthening the protective role of non-coding
   DNA/heterochromatin could potentially offer better systematic protection
   for the dynamic genome and the exome against diverse assaults, reduce
   the burden of DNA damage to the exome, and thus slow ageing, counteract
   age-related genetic diseases and promote a healthier life for
   individuals.},

Title = {Female ageing affects the DNA repair capacity of oocytes in IVF using a
   controlled model of sperm DNA damage in mice},
Journal = {HUMAN REPRODUCTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {35},
Number = {3},
Pages = {529-544},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {STUDY QUESTION: Does female ageing have a negative effect on the DNA
   repair capacity of oocytes fertilised by spermatozoa with controlled
   levels of DNA damage?
   SUMMARY ANSWER: Compared to oocytes from younger females, oocytes from
   older females have a reduced capacity to repair damaged DNA introduced
   by spermatozoa.
   WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: The reproductive lifespan in women declines with
   age predominantly due to poor oocyte quality. This leads to decreased
   reproductive outcomes for older women undergoing assisted reproductive
   technology (ART) treatments, compared to young women. Ageing and oocyte
   quality have been clearly associated with aneuploidy, but the range of
   factors that influence this change in oocyte quality with age remains
   unclear. The DNA repair activity prior to embryonic genomic activation
   is considered to be of maternal origin, with maternal transcripts and
   proteins controlling DNA integrity. With increasing maternal age, the
   number of mRNAs stored in oocytes decreases. This could result in
   diminished efficiency of DNA repair and/or negative effects on embryo
   development, especially in the presence of DNA damage.
   STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: Oocytes from two age groups of 30
   super-ovulated female mice (young: 5-8 weeks old, n= 15; old: 42-45
   weeks old, n= 15) were inseminated with sperm from five males with three
   different controlled DNA damage levels; control: <= 10\%, 1 Gray (Gy):
   11-30\%, and 30 Gy: >30\%. Inseminated oocytes (young: 125, old: 78)
   were assessed for the formation of zygotes (per oocyte) and blastocysts
   (per zygote). Five replicates of five germinal vesicles (GVs) and five
   MII oocytes from each age group were analysed for gene expression. The
   DNA damage response (DDR) was assessed in a minimum of three IVF
   replicates in control and I Gy zygotes and two-cell embryos using gamma
   H2AX labelling.
   PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Swim-up sperm samples from the
   cauda epididymidis of C57BL6 mice were divided into control (no
   irradiation) and I- and 30-Gy groups. Treated spermatozoa were
   irradiated at 1 and 30 Gy, respectively, using a linear accelerator
   Varian 21iX. Following irradiation, samples were used for DNA damage
   assessment (Halomax) and for insemination. Presumed zygotes were
   cultured in a time-lapse incubator (MIRI, ESCO). Gene expression of 91
   DNA repair genes was assessed using the Fluidigm Biomark HD system. The
   DNA damage response in zygotes (6-8 h post-fertilisation) and two-cell
   embryos (22-24 h post-fertilisation) was assessed by immunocytochemical
   analysis of gamma H2AX using confocal microscopy (Olympus FV1200) and 3D
   volumetric analysis using IMARIS software.
   MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: The average sperm DNA damage for
   the three groups was statistically different (control: 6.1\%, I Gy:
   16.1\%, 30 Gy: 53.1\%, P < 0.0001), but there were no significant
   differences in fertilisation rates after IVF within or between the two
   age groups {[}(young; control: 86.79\%, I Gy: 82.75\%, 30 Gy: 76.74\%)
   (old; control: 93.1\%, I Gy: 70.37\%, 30 Gy: 68.18\%) Fisher's exact].
   However, blastocyst rates were significantly different (P < 0.0001)
   among the groups {[}(young; control: 86.95\%, I Gy: 33.33\%, 30 Gy:
   0.0\%) (old; control: 70.37\%, I Gy: 0.0\%, 30 Gy: 0.0\%)]. Between the
   age groups, I -Gy samples showed a significant decrease in the
   blastocyst rate in old females compared to young females (P= 0.0166).
   Gene expression analysis revealed a decrease in relative expression of
   21 DNA repair genes in old GV oocytes compared to young GV oocytes (P <
   0.05), and similarly, old MII oocytes showed 23 genes with reduced
   expression compared to young MII oocytes (P < 0.05). The number of genes
   with decreased expression in older GV and MII oocytes significantly
   affected pathways such as double strand break (GV: 5; MII: 6),
   nucleotide excision repair (GV: 8; MU: 5) and DNA damage response (GV:
   4; MII: 8). There was a decreased DDR in zygotes and in two-cell embryos
   from old females compared to young regardless of sperm treatment (P <
   0.05). The decrease in DNA repair gene expression of oocytes and
   decreased DDR in embryos derived from older females suggests that ageing
   results in a diminished DNA repair capacity.
   LARGE-SCALE DATA: N/A
   LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Ionising radiation was used only for
   experimental purposes, aiming at controlled levels of sperm DNA damage;
   however, it can also damage spermatozoa proteins. The female age groups
   selected in mice were intended to model effects in young and old women,
   but clinical studies are required to demonstrate a similar effect.
   WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Fertilisation can occur with sperm
   populations with medium and high DNA damage, but subsequent embryo
   growth is affected to a greater extent with aging females, supporting
   the theory that oocyte DNA repair capacity decreases with age.
   Assessment of the oocyte DNA repair capacity may be a useful diagnostic
   tool for infertile couples.},

Journal = {CELL REPORTS},

Volume = {23},
Number = {2},

Month = {APR 10},
Abstract = {Transcriptional dysregulation of the MYC oncogene is among the most
   frequent events in aggressive tumor cells, and this is generally
   accomplished by acquisition of a super-enhancer somewhere within the 2.8
   Mb TAD where MYC resides. We find that these diverse cancer-specific
   super-enhancers, differing in size and location, interact with the MYC
   gene through a common and conserved CTCF binding site located 2 kb
   upstream of the MYC promoter. Genetic perturbation of this
   enhancer-docking site in tumor cells reduces CTCF binding,
   super-enhancer interaction, MYC gene expression, and cell proliferation.
   CTCF binding is highly sensitive to DNA methylation, and this
   enhancer-docking site, which is hypomethylated in diverse cancers, can
   be inactivated through epigenetic editing with dCas9-DNMT. Similar
   enhancer-docking sites occur at other genes, including genes with
   prominent roles in multiple cancers, suggesting a mechanism by which
   tumor cell oncogenes can generally hijack enhancers. These results
   provide insights into mechanisms that allow a single target gene to be
   regulated by diverse enhancer elements in different cell types.},

Abstract = {Control of gene expression depends on a complex and delicate balance of
   various posttranslational modifications of histones. However, the
   relevance of specific combinations of histone modifications is not fully
   defined. Downstream effector proteins recognize particular histone
   modifications and transduce this information into gene expression
   patterns. Methylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me) is a landmark
   of gene expression control in eukaryotes. Its recognition depends on the
   presence in the effector protein of a motif termed plant homeodomain
   (PHD) that specifically binds to H3K4me3. Here, we establish that
   Arabidopsis ORC1, the large subunit of the origin recognition complex
   involved in defining origins of DNA replication, functions as a
   transcriptional activator of a subset of genes, the promoters of which
   are preferentially bound by ORC1. Arabidopsis ORC1 contains a PHD and
   binds to H3K4me3. In addition to H4 acetylation, ORC1 binding correlates
   with increased H4K20me3 in the proximal promoter region of ORC1 targets.
   This suggests that H4K20me3, unlike in animal cells, is associated with
   transcriptional activation in Arabidopsis. Thus, our data provide a
   molecular basis for the opposite role of ORC1 in transcriptional
   activation in plants and repression in animals. Since only ORC1 proteins
   of plant species contain a PHD, we propose that plant ORC1 constitutes a
   novel class of H3K4me3 effector proteins characteristic of the plant
   kingdom.},

Abstract = {Although somatic homologous pairing is common in Drosophila it is not
   generally observed in mammalian cells. However, a number of regions have
   recently been shown to come into close proximity with their homologous
   allele, and it has been proposed that pairing might be involved in the
   establishment or maintenance of monoallelic expression. Here, we
   investigate the pairing properties of various imprinted and
   non-imprinted regions in mouse tissues and ES cells. We find by
   allele-specific 4C-Seq and DNA FISH that the Kcnq1 imprinted region
   displays frequent pairing but that this is not dependent on monoallelic
   expression. We demonstrate that pairing involves larger chromosomal
   regions and that the two chromosome territories come close together.
   Frequent pairing is not associated with imprinted status or DNA repair,
   but is influenced by chromosomal location and transcription. We propose
   that homologous pairing is not exclusive to specialised regions or
   specific functional events, and speculate that it provides the cell with
   the opportunity of trans-allelic effects on gene regulation.},

Abstract = {The localization of genes within the nuclear space is of paramount
   importance for proper genome functions. However, very little is known on
   the cis-acting elements determining subnuclear positioning of chromosome
   segments. We show here that the D4Z4 human subtelomeric repeat localizes
   a telomere at the nuclear periphery. This perinuclear activity lies
   within an 80 bp sequence included within a region known to interact with
   CTCF and A-type Lamins. We further show that a reduced level of either
   CTCF or A-type Lamins suppresses the perinuclear activities of D4Z4 and
   that an array of multimerized D4Z4 sequence, which has lost its ability
   to bind CTCF and A-type Lamins, is not localized at the periphery.
   Overall, these findings reveal the existence of an 80 bp D4Z4 sequence
   that is sufficient to position an adjacent telomere to the nuclear
   periphery in a CTCF and A-type lamins-dependent manner. Strikingly, this
   sequence includes a 30 bp GA-rich motif, which binds CTCF and is present
   at several locations in the human genome. The EMBO Journal (2009) 28,

Abstract = {Progenitor-B cells recombine their immunoglobulin (Ig) loci to create
   unique antigen receptors. Despite a common recombination machinery, the
   Ig heavy and Ig light chain loci rearrange in a stepwise manner. We
   studied pre-pro-B cells and Rag(-/-) progenitor-B cells to determine
   whether Ig locus contraction or nuclear positioning is decisive for
   stepwise rearrangements. We found that both Ig loci were contracted in
   pro-B and pre-B cells. Ig kappa relocated from the nuclear lamina to
   central domains only at the proB cell stage, whereas, Ig. remained
   sequestered at the lamina, and only at the pre-B cell stage located to
   central nuclear domains. Finally, in vitro induced re-positioning of Ig
   alleles away from the nuclear periphery increased germline transcription
   of Ig loci in pre-pro-B cells. Thus, Ig locus contraction juxtaposes
   genomically distant elements to mediate efficient recombination,
   however, sequential positioning of Ig loci away from the nuclear
   periphery determines stage-specific accessibility of Ig loci.},

Abstract = {As epigenetic readers, bromodomain and extra-terminal domain (BET)
   family proteins bind to acetylated-lysine residues in histones and
   recruit protein complexes to promote transcription initiation and
   elongation. Inhibition of BET bromodomains by small molecule inhibitors
   has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy for cancer. Herein, we
   describe our efforts toward the discovery of a novel series of
   1-(5-(1H-benzo{[}d]imidazole-2-yl)-2,4-dimethyl-1H-pyrrol-3-yl)ethan-1-o
   ne derivatives as BET inhibitors. Intensive structural modifications led
   to the identification of compound 35f as the most active inhibitor of
   BET BRD4 with selectivity against BET family proteins. Further
   biological studies revealed that compound 35f can arrest the cell cycle
   in G(0)/G(1) phase and induce apoptosis via decreasing the expression of
   c-Myc and other proteins related to cell cycle and apoptosis. More
   importantly, compound 35f showed favorable pharmacokinetic properties
   and antitumor efficacy in MV4-11 mouse xenograft model with acceptable
   tolerability. These results indicated that BET inhibitors could be
   potentially used to treat hematologic malignancies and some solid
   tumors. (C) 2021 Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.},

Abstract = {Chromosome large-scale organization is a beautiful example of the
   interplay between physics and biology. DNA molecules are polymers and
   thus belong to the class of molecules for which physicists have
   developed models and formulated testable hypotheses to understand their
   arrangement and dynamic properties in solution, based on the principles
   of polymer physics. Biologists documented and discovered the biochemical
   basis for the structure, function and dynamic spatial organization of
   chromosomes in cells. The underlying principles of chromosome
   organization have recently been revealed in unprecedented detail using
   high-resolution chromosome capture technology that can simultaneously
   detect chromosome contact sites throughout the genome. These independent
   lines of investigation have now converged on a model in which DNA loops,
   generated by the loop extrusion mechanism, are the basic organizational
   and functional units of the chromosome.},

Abstract = {The spatial organization of the genome into compartments and
   topologically associated domains can have an important role in the
   regulation of gene expression. But could gene expression conversely
   regulate genome organization? Here, we review recent studies that
   assessed the requirement of transcription and/or the transcription
   machinery for the establishment or maintenance of genome topology. The
   results reveal different requirements at different genomic scales.
   Transcription is generally not required for higher-level genome
   compartmentalization, has only moderate effects on domain organization
   and is not sufficient to create new domain boundaries. However, on a
   finer scale, transcripts or transcription does seem to have a role in
   the formation of subcompartments and subdomains and in stabilizing
   enhancer-promoter interactions. Recent evidence suggests a dynamic,
   reciprocal interplay between fine-scale genome organization and
   transcription, in which each is able to modulate or reinforce the
   activity of the other.},

   examine the nuclear arrangement of 10 chromosomes in human epithelial
   cancer cells by three-dimensional FISH analysis. We show that their
   radial position correlates with the ratio of their gene density to
   chromosome size. We also observe that inter-homologue distances are
   generally larger than inter-heterologue distances. Using numerical
   simulations taking radial position constraints into account, we
   demonstrate that, for some chromosomes, radial position is enough to
   justify the inter-homologue distance, whereas for others additional
   constraints are involved. Among these constraints, we propose that
   nucleolar organizer regions participate in the internal positioning of
   the acrocentric chromosome HSA21, possibly through interactions with
   nucleoli. Maintaining distance between homologous chromosomes in human
   cells could participate in regulating genome stability and gene
   expression, both mechanisms that are key players in tumorigenesis.},

Title = {Sub-kb Hi-C in <i>D</i>. <i>melanogaster</i> reveals conserved
   characteristics of TADs between insect and mammalian cells},
Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {9},
Month = {JAN 15},
Abstract = {Topologically associating domains (TADs) are fundamental elements of the
   eukaryotic genomic structure. However, recent studies suggest that the
   insulating complexes, CTCF/cohesin, present at TAD borders in mammals
   are absent from those in Drosophila melanogaster, raising the
   possibility that border elements are not conserved among metazoans.
   Using in situ Hi-C with sub-kb resolution, here we show that the D.
   melanogaster genome is almost completely partitioned into >4000 TADs,
   nearly sevenfold more than previously identified. The overwhelming
   majority of these TADs are demarcated by the insulator complexes,
   BEAF-32/CP190, or BEAF-32/Chromator, indicating that these proteins may
   play an analogous role in flies as that of CTCF/cohesin in mammals.
   Moreover, extended regions previously thought to be unstructured are
   shown to consist of small contiguous TADs, a property also observed in
   mammals upon re-examination. Altogether, our work demonstrates that
   fundamental features associated with the higher-order folding of the
   genome are conserved from insects to mammals.},

Volume = {312},

Abstract = {Using sequential RNA-DNA fluorescence in situ hybridization, the nuclear
   arrangement of both the active and inactive c-myc gene as well as its
   transcription was investigated in colon cancer HT-29 cells induced to
   differentiate into enterocytes. Cytogenetic studies revealed the
   presence of two chromosomes 8 in HT-29 cells, of which the one
   containing c-myc gene amplicons was substantially larger and easily
   distinguished from the normal chromosome. This observation enabled
   detection of both activity and nuclear localization of c-myc genes in
   single cells and in individual chromosome territories. Similar
   transcriptional activity of the c-myc gene was observed in both the
   normal and derivative chromosome 8 territories showing no influence of
   the amplification on the c-myc gene expression. Our experiments
   demonstrate strikingly specific nuclear and territorial arrangements of
   active genes as compared with inactive ones: on the periphery of their
   territories facing to the very central region of the cell nucleus.
   Nuclear arrangement of c-myc genes and transcripts was conserved during
   cell differentiation and, therefore, independent of the level of
   differentiation-specific c-myc gene expression. However, after the
   induction of differentiation, a more internal territorial location was
   found for the single copy c-myc gene of normal chromosome 8, while
   amplicons conserved their territorial topography. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Title = {Mitogen-induced distinct epialleles are phosphorylated at either H3S10
   or H3S28, depending on H3K27 acetylation},
Journal = {MOLECULAR BIOLOGY OF THE CELL},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {28},

Month = {MAR 15},
Abstract = {Stimulation of the MAPK pathway results in mitogen-and stress-activated
   protein kinase 1/2 (MSK1/2)-catalyzed phosphorylation of histone H3 at
   serine 10 or 28 and expression of immediate-early (IE) genes. In 10T1/2
   mouse fibroblasts, phosphorylation of H3S10 and H3S28 occurs on
   different H3 molecules and in different nuclear regions. Similarly, we
   show that mitogen-induced H3S10 and H3S28 phosphorylation occurs in
   separate pools in human primary fibroblasts. High-resolution imaging
   studies on both cell types reveal that H3S10 and H3S28 phosphorylation
   events can be induced in a single cell but on different alleles, giving
   rise to H3S10ph and H3S28ph epialleles. Coimmunoprecipitation and
   inhibition studies demonstrate that CBP/p300-mediated H3K27 acetylation
   is required for MSK1/2 to phosphorylate S28. Although the K9ac and S10ph
   marks coexist on H3, S10 phosphorylation is not dependent on K9
   acetylation by PCAF. We propose that random targeting of H3S10 or H3S28
   results from the stochastic acetylation of H3 by CBP/p300 or PCAF, a
   process comparable to transcriptional bursting causing temporary allelic
   imbalance. In 10T1/2 cells expressing Jun, at least two of three alleles
   per cell were induced, a sign of high expression level. The redundant
   roles of H3S10ph and H3S28ph might enable rapid and efficient IE gene
   induction.},

Abstract = {The MYC axis is disrupted in cancer, predominantly through activation of
   the MYC family oncogenes but also through inactivation of the MYC
   partner MAX or of the MAX partner MGA. MGA and MAX are also members of
   the polycomb repressive complex, ncPRC1.6. Here, we use genetically
   modified MAX-deficient small cell lung cancer (SCLC) cells and carry out
   genome-wide and proteomics analyses to study the tumor suppressor
   function of MAX. We find that MAX mutant SCLCs have ASCL1 or NEUROD1 or
   combined ASCL1/NEUROD1 characteristics and lack MYC transcriptional
   activity. MAX restitution triggers prodifferentiation expression
   profiles that shift when MAX and oncogenic MYC are coexpressed. Although
   ncPRC1.6 can be formed, the lack of MAX restricts global MGA occupancy,
   selectively driving its recruitment toward E2F6binding motifs.
   Conversely, MAX restitution enhances MGA occupancy to repress genes
   involved in different functions, including stem cell and DNA
   repair/replication. Collectively, these findings reveal that MAX mutant
   SCLCs have either ASCL1 or NEUROD1 or combined characteristics and are
   MYC independent and exhibit deficient ncPRC1.6-mediated gene repression.},

Abstract = {Cancer arises from genetic alterations that produce dysregulated gene
   expression programs. Normal gene regulation occurs in the context of
   chromosome loop structures called insulated neighborhoods, and recent
   studies have shown that these structures are altered and can contribute
   to oncogene dysregulation in various cancer cells. Wereview the types of
   genetic and epigenetic alterations that influence neighborhood
   structures and contribute to gene dysregulation in cancer, present
   models for insulated neighborhoods associated with the most prominent
   human oncogenes, and discuss how such models may lead to further
   advances in cancer diagnosis and therapy.},

Abstract = {Understanding how transcriptional enhancers control over 20,000
   protein-coding genes to maintain cell-type-specific gene expression
   programs in all human cells is a fundamental challenge in regulatory
   biology. Recent studies suggest that gene regulatory elements and their
   target genes generally occur within insulated neighborhoods, which are
   chromosomal loop structures formed by the interaction of two DNA sites
   bound by the CTCF protein and occupied by the cohesin complex. Here, we
   review evidence that insulated neighborhoods provide for specific
   enhancer-gene interactions, are essential for both normal gene
   activation and repression, form a chromosome scaffold that is largely
   preserved throughout development, and are perturbed by genetic and
   epigenetic factors in disease. Insulated neighborhoods are a powerful
   paradigm for gene control that provides new insights into development
   and disease.},

Abstract = {In the developing retina, multipotent neural progenitors undergo
   unidirectional differentiation in a precise spatiotemporal order. Here
   we profile the epigenetic and transcriptional changes that occur during
   retinogenesis in mice and humans. Although some progenitor genes and
   cell cycle genes were epigenetically silenced during retinogenesis, the
   most dramatic change was derepression of cell-type-specific
   differentiation programs. We identified developmental-stage-specific
   super-enhancers and showed that most epigenetic changes are conserved in
   humans and mice. To determine how the epigenome changes during
   tumorigenesis and reprogramming, we performed integrated epigenetic
   analysis of murine and human retinoblastomas and induced pluripotent
   stem cells (iPSCs) derived from murine rod photoreceptors. The
   retinoblastoma epigenome mapped to the developmental stage when retinal
   progenitors switch from neurogenic to terminal patterns of cell
   division. The epigenome of retinoblastomas was more similar to that of
   the normal retina than that of retina-derived iPSCs, and we identified
   retina-specific epigenetic memory.},

Abstract = {Chromosome conformation capture (3C)-based techniques have
   revolutionized the field of nuclear organization, partly replacing DNA
   FISH as the method of choice for studying three-dimensional chromosome
   architecture. Although DNA FISH is commonly used for confirming 3C-based
   findings, the two techniques are conceptually and technically different
   and comparing their results is not trivial. Here, we discuss both
   3C-based techniques and DNA FISH approaches to highlight their
   similarities and differences. We then describe the technical biases that
   affect each approach, and review the available reports that address
   their compatibility. Finally, we propose an experimental scheme for
   comparison of 3C and DNA FISH results.},

Title = {Genome-wide analysis of histone modifications that underlie the dynamic
   changes in gene expression during decidualization in human endometrial
   stromal cells},
Journal = {MOLECULAR HUMAN REPRODUCTION},
Year = {2023},

Abstract = {Human endometrial stromal cells (hESCs) undergo a differentiation
   process with dramatic changes in cell functions during the menstrual
   cycle, which is called decidualization. This is an important event for
   implantation of the embryo and successful pregnancy. Defective
   decidualization can cause implantation failure, miscarriage, and
   unexplained infertility. A number of genes are upregulated or
   downregulated during decidualization. Recent studies have shown that
   epigenetic mechanisms are involved in the regulation of
   decidualization-related genes and that histone modifications occur
   throughout the genome during decidualization. The present review focuses
   on the involvement of genome-wide histone modifications in dramatic
   changes in gene expression during decidualization. The main histone
   modifications are the increases of H3K27ac and H3K4me3, which activate
   transcription. C/EBPb works as a pioneer factor throughout the genome by
   recruiting p300. This is the main cause of the genome-wide acetylation
   of H3K27 during decidualization. Histone modifications were observed in
   both the proximal promoter and distal enhancer regions. Genome editing
   experiments show that the distal regions have transcriptional
   activities, which suggests that decidualization induces the interactions
   between proximal promoter and distal enhancer regions. Taken together,
   these findings show that gene regulation during decidualization is
   closely associated with genome-wide changes of histone modifications.
   This review provides new insights regarding the cases of implantation
   failure in terms of decidualization insufficiency owing to epigenetic
   dysregulation, and may lead to novel treatment options for women with
   implantation failure.},

Abstract = {Low-flow vascular malformations are congenital overgrowths composed of
   abnormal blood vessels potentially causing pain, bleeding and
   obstruction of different organs. These diseases are caused by oncogenic
   mutations in the endothelium, which result in overactivation of the
   PI3K/AKT pathway. Lack of robust in vivo preclinical data has prevented
   the development and translation into clinical trials of specific
   molecular therapies for these diseases. Here, we demonstrate that the
   Pik3ca(H1047R) activating mutation in endothelial cells triggers a
   transcriptome rewiring that leads to enhanced cell proliferation. We
   describe a new reproducible preclinical in vivo model of PI3K-driven
   vascular malformations using the postnatal mouse retina. We show that
   active angiogenesis is required for the pathogenesis of vascular
   malformations caused by activating Pik3ca mutations. Using this model,
   we demonstrate that the AKT inhibitor miransertib both prevents and
   induces the regression of PI3K-driven vascular malformations. We
   confirmed the efficacy of miransertib in isolated human endothelial
   cells with genotypes spanning most of human low-flow vascular
   malformations.},

Title = {Vertebrate centromeres in mitosis are functionally bipartite structures
   stabilized by cohesin},
Journal = {CELL},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {187},
Number = {12},
Month = {JUN 6},
Abstract = {Centromeres are scaffolds for the assembly of kinetochores that ensure
   chromosome segregation during cell division. How vertebrate centromeres
   obtain a three-dimensional structure to accomplish their primary
   function is unclear. Using super -resolution imaging, capture -C, and
   polymer modeling, we show that vertebrate centromeres are partitioned by
   condensins into two subdomains during mitosis. The bipartite structure
   is found in human, mouse, and chicken cells and is therefore a
   fundamental feature of vertebrate centromeres. Super -resolution imaging
   and electron tomography reveal that bipartite centromeres assemble
   bipartite kinetochores, with each subdomain binding a distinct
   microtubule bundle. Cohesin links the centromere subdomains, limiting
   their separation in response to spindle forces and avoiding merotelic
   kinetochore-spindle attachments. Lagging chromosomes during cancer cell
   divisions frequently have merotelic attachments in which the centromere
   subdomains are separated and bioriented. Our work reveals a fundamental
   aspect of vertebrate centromere biology with implications for
   understanding the mechanisms that guarantee faithful chromosome
   segregation.},

Abstract = {The immunoglobulin heavy-chain (Igh) locus undergoes large-scale
   contraction in pro-B cells, which facilitates V-H-DJ(H) recombination by
   juxtaposing distal V-H genes next to the DJ(H)-rearranged gene segment
   in the 3' proximal Igh domain. By using high-resolution mapping of
   long-range interactions, we demonstrate that local interaction domains
   established the three-dimensional structure of the extended Igh locus in
   lymphoid progenitors. In proB cells, these local domains engaged in
   long-range interactions across the Igh locus, which depend on the
   regulators Pax5, YY1, and CTCF. The large VH gene cluster underwent
   flexible long-range interactions with the more rigidly structured
   proximal domain, which probably ensures similar participation of all V-H
   genes in V-H-DJ(H) recombination to generate a diverse antibody
   repertoire. These long-range interactions appear to be an intrinsic
   feature of the V-H gene cluster, because they are still generated upon
   mutation of the E mu enhancer, IGCR1 insulator, or 30 regulatory region
   in the proximal Igh domain.},

Abstract = {The past decade has increased our understanding of how genome topology
   controls RAG endonuclease-mediated assembly of lymphocyte AgR genes. New
   technologies have illuminated how the large IgH, Ig kappa, TCR
   alpha/delta, and TCR beta loci fold into compact structures that place
   their numerous V gene segments in similar three-dimensional proximity to
   their distal recombination center composed of RAG-bound (D) J gene
   segments. Many studies have shown that CTCF and cohesin protein-mediated
   chromosome looping have fundamental roles in lymphocyte lineage- and
   developmental stage-specific locus compaction as well as broad usage of
   V segments. CTCF/cohesin-dependent loops have also been shown to direct
   and restrict RAG activity within chromosome domains. We summarize recent
   work in elucidating molecular mechanisms that govern three-dimensional
   chromosome organization and in investigating how these dynamic
   mechanisms control V(D)J recombination. We also introduce remaining
   questions for how CTCF/cohesin-dependent and -independent genome
   architectural mechanisms might regulate compaction and recombination of
   AgR loci.},

Title = {DNA packaging by molecular motors: from bacteriophage to human
   chromosomes},

Year = {2024},
Volume = {25},

Abstract = {Dense packaging of genomic DNA is crucial for organismal survival, as
   DNA length always far exceeds the dimensions of the cells that contain
   it. Organisms, therefore, use sophisticated machineries to package their
   genomes. These systems range across kingdoms from a single
   ultra-powerful rotary motor that spools the DNA into a bacteriophage
   head, to hundreds of thousands of relatively weak molecular motors that
   coordinate the compaction of mitotic chromosomes in eukaryotic cells.
   Recent technological advances, such as DNA proximity-based sequencing
   approaches, polymer modelling and in vitro reconstitution of DNA loop
   extrusion, have shed light on the biological mechanisms driving DNA
   organization in different systems. Here, we discuss DNA packaging in
   bacteriophage, bacteria and eukaryotic cells, which, despite their
   extreme variation in size, structure and genomic content, all rely on
   the action of molecular motors to package their genomes.
   In this Review, the authors summarize DNA packaging in bacteriophage,
   bacteria and eukaryotic cells. They describe the difficulties each
   system faces when packaging its DNA, outline the molecular motor
   components involved, and provide insights from new studies that reveal
   how DNA organization is achieved.},

Title = {Single-cell absolute contact probability detection reveals chromosomes
   are organized by multiple low-frequency yet specific interactions},
Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {8},
Month = {NOV 24},
Abstract = {At the kilo-to megabase pair scales, eukaryotic genomes are partitioned
   into self-interacting modules or topologically associated domains (TADs)
   that associate to form nuclear compartments. Here, we combine
   high-content super-resolution microscopies with state-of-theart
   DNA-labeling methods to reveal the variability in the multiscale
   organization of the Drosophila genome. We find that association
   frequencies within TADs and between TAD borders are below similar to
   10\%, independently of TAD size, epigenetic state, or cell type.
   Critically, despite this large heterogeneity, we are able to visualize
   nanometer-sized epigenetic domains at the single-cell level. In
   addition, absolute contact frequencies within and between TADs are to a
   large extent defined by genomic distance, higher-order chromosome
   architecture, and epigenetic identity. We propose that TADs and
   compartments are organized by multiple, small-frequency, yet specific
   interactions that are regulated by epigenetics and transcriptional
   state.},

Abstract = {DNA replication is temporally and spatially organized in all eukaryotes,
   yet the molecular control and biological function of the
   replication-timing program are unclear. Rif1 is required for normal
   genome-wide regulation of replication timing, but its molecular function
   is poorly understood. Here we show that in mouse embryonic stem cells,
   Rif1 coats late-replicating domains and, with Lamin B1, identifies most
   of the late-replicating genome. Rif1 is an essential determinant of
   replication timing of non-Lamin B1-bound late domains. We further
   demonstrate that Rif1 defines and restricts the interactions between
   replication-timing domains during the G1 phase, thereby revealing a
   function of Rif1 as organizer of nuclear architecture. Rif1 loss affects
   both number and replication-timing specificity of the interactions
   between replication-timing domains. In addition, during the S phase,
   Rif1 ensures that replication of interacting domains is temporally
   coordinated. In summary, our study identifies Rif1 as the molecular link
   between nuclear architecture and replication-timing establishment in
   mammals.},

Abstract = {Mutations in LMNA, which encodes the nuclear proteins Lamin A/C, can

   K219T-LMNA, have altered action potential, reduced peak sodium current
   and diminished conduction velocity. Moreover, they have significantly
   downregulated Na(v)1.5 channel expression and increased binding of Lamin
   A/C to the promoter of SCN5A, the channel's gene. Coherently, binding of
   the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) protein SUZ12 and deposition of
   the repressive histone mark H3K27me3 are increased at SCN5A.
   CRISPR/Cas9-mediated correction of the mutation re-establishes sodium
   current density and SCN5A expression. Thus, K219T-LMNA cooperates with
   PRC2 in downregulating SCN5A, leading to decreased sodium current
   density and slower conduction velocity. This mechanism may underlie the
   conduction abnormalities associated with LMNA-cardiomyopathy.},

Abstract = {DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) at RNA polymerase II (RNAPII)
   transcribed genes lead to inhibition of transcription. The DNA-dependent
   protein kinase (DNA-PK) complex plays a pivotal role in transcription
   inhibition at DSBs by stimulating proteasome-dependent eviction of
   RNAPII at these lesions. How DNA-PK triggers RNAPII eviction to inhibit
   transcription at DSBs remains unclear. Here we show that the HECT E3
   ubiquitin ligase WWP2 associates with components of the DNA-PK and
   RNAPII complexes and is recruited to DSBs at RNAPII transcribed genes.
   In response to DSBs, WWP2 targets the RNAPII subunit RPB1 for K48-linked
   ubiquitylation, thereby driving DNA-PK-and proteasome-dependent eviction
   of RNAPII. The lack of WWP2 or expression of nonubiquitylatable RPB1
   abrogates the binding of nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) factors,
   including DNA-PK and XRCC4/DNA ligase IV, and impairs DSB repair. These
   findings suggest that WWP2 operates in a DNA-PK-dependent shutoff
   circuitry for RNAPII clearance that promotes DSB repair by protecting
   the NHEJ machinery from collision with the transcription machinery.},

Abstract = {Surgical resection with lymphadenectomy and perioperative chemotherapy
   is the universal mainstay for curative treatment of gastric cancer (GC)
   patients with locoregional disease. However, GC survival remains
   asymmetric in West- and East-world regions. We hypothesize that this
   asymmetry derives from differential clinical management. Therefore, we
   collected chemo-naive GC patients from Portugal and South Korea to
   explore specific immunophenotypic profiles related to disease
   aggressiveness and clinicopathological factors potentially explaining
   associated overall survival (OS) differences. Clinicopathological and
   survival data were collected from chemo-naive surgical cohorts from
   Portugal (West-Europe cohort {[}WE-C]; n = 170) and South Korea
   (East-Asia cohort {[}EA-C]; n = 367) and correlated with
   immunohistochemical expression profiles of E-cadherin and CD44v6
   obtained from consecutive tissue microarrays sections. Survival analysis
   revealed a subset of 12.4\% of WE-C patients, whose tumors concomitantly
   express E-cadherin\_abnormal and CD44v6\_very high, displaying extremely
   poor OS, even at TNM stages I and II. These WE-C stage-I and -II
   patients tumors were particularly aggressive compared to all others,
   invading deeper into the gastric wall (P = .032) and more often
   permeating the vasculature (P = .018) and nerves (P = .009). A similar
   immunophenotypic profile was found in 11.9\% of EA-C patients, but
   unrelated to survival. Tumours, from stage-I and -II EA-C patients, that
   display both biomarkers, also permeated more lymphatic vessels (P =
   .003), promoting lymph node (LN) metastasis (P = .019), being diagnosed
   on average 8 years earlier and submitted to more extensive LN dissection
   than WE-C. Concomitant E-cadherin\_abnormal/CD44v6\_very-high expression
   predicts aggressiveness and poor survival of stage-I and -II GC
   submitted to conservative lymphadenectomy.},

Abstract = {PR homology domain-containing member 12 (PRDM12) belongs to a family of
   conserved transcription factors implicated in cell fate decisions. Here
   we show that PRDM12 is a key regulator of sensory neuronal specification
   in Xenopus. Modeling of human PRDM12 mutations that cause hereditary
   sensory and autonomic neuropathy (HSAN) revealed remarkable conservation
   of the mutated residues in evolution. Expression of wild-type human
   PRDM12 in Xenopus induced the expression of sensory neuronal markers,
   which was reduced using various human PRDM12 mutants. In Drosophila, we
   identified Hamlet as the functional PRDM12 homolog that controls
   nociceptive behavior in sensory neurons. Furthermore, expression
   analysis of human patient fibroblasts with PRDM12 mutations uncovered
   possible downstream target genes. Knockdown of several of these target
   genes including thyrotropin-releasing hormone degrading enzyme (TRHDE)
   in Drosophila sensory neurons resulted in altered cellular morphology
   and impaired nociception. These data show that PRDM12 and its functional
   fly homolog Hamlet are evolutionary conserved master regulators of
   sensory neuronal specification and play a critical role in pain
   perception. Our data also uncover novel pathways in multiple species
   that regulate evolutionary conserved nociception.},

Abstract = {The 2021 Annual Review Issue of The Journal of Pathology contains 14
   invited reviews on current research areas of particular importance in
   pathology. The subjects included here reflect the broad range of
   interests covered by the journal, including both basic and applied
   research fields but always with the aim of improving our understanding
   of human disease. This year, our reviews encompass the huge impact of
   the COVID-19 pandemic, the development and application of biomarkers for
   immune checkpoint inhibitors, recent advances in multiplexing
   antigen/nucleic acid detection in situ, the use of genomics to aid drug
   discovery, organoid methodologies in research, the microbiome in cancer,
   the role of macrophage-stroma interactions in fibrosis, and TGF-beta as
   a driver of fibrosis in multiple pathologies. Other reviews revisit the
   p53 field and its lack of clinical impact to date, dissect the genetics
   of mitochondrial diseases, summarise the cells of origin and genetics of
   sarcomagenesis, provide new data on the role of TRIM28 in tumour
   predisposition, review our current understanding of cancer stem cell
   niches, and the function and regulation of p63. The reviews are authored
   by experts in their field from academia and industry, and provide
   comprehensive updates of the chosen areas, in which there has been
   considerable recent progress. (c) 2021 The Pathological Society of Great

Title = {Epithelial-Mesenchymal Plasticity Induced by Discontinuous Exposure to
   TGFβ1 Promotes Tumour Growth},
Journal = {BIOLOGY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {11},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Simple Summary In this manuscript, we used a non-genetically manipulated
   EMT/MET cell line model to demonstrate that epithelial mesenchymal
   plasticity occurring in normal cells generates co-existing
   phenotypically and functionally divergent cell subpopulations which
   result in fast growing tumours in vivo. Transitions between epithelial
   and mesenchymal cellular states (EMT/MET) contribute to cancer
   progression. We hypothesize that EMT followed by MET promotes cell
   population heterogeneity, favouring tumour growth. We developed an EMT
   model by on and off exposure of epithelial EpH4 cells (E-cells) to TGF
   beta 1 that mimics phenotypic EMT (M-cells) and MET. We aimed at
   understanding whether phenotypic MET is accompanied by molecular and
   functional reversion back to epithelia by using RNA sequencing,
   immunofluorescence (IF), proliferation, wound healing, focus formation
   and mamosphere formation assays as well as cell xenografts in nude mice.
   Phenotypic reverted epithelial cells (RE-cells) obtained after MET
   induction presented epithelial morphologies and proliferation rates
   resembling E cells. However, the RE transcriptomic profile and IF
   staining of epithelial and mesenchymal markers revealed a uniquely
   heterogeneous mixture of cell subpopulations with a high self-renewal
   ability. RE cell heterogeneity was stably maintained for long periods
   after TGF beta 1 removal both in vitro and in large tumours derived from
   the nude mice. Overall, we show that phenotypic reverted epithelial
   cells (RE cells) do not return to the molecular and functional
   epithelial state and present mesenchymal features related to
   aggressiveness and cellular heterogeneity that favour tumour growth in
   vivo. This work strengthens epithelial cell reprogramming and cellular
   heterogeneity fostered by inflammatory cues as a tumour growth-promoting
   factor in vivo.},
